# Sentiment-analysis-Donald-Trump
In this project I have explored President Trump's tweet from three different data sets, ranging from autumn 2015 to autumn 2018. Number of tweets were analysed and during what part of the day the tweets occurred the most. Wordclouds were used to see the most meaningful words that were tweeted before president and during the presidential period. Lastly, a sentiment analysis was performed to see the average tweets sentiment per day.
