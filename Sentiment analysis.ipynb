“apparently” @foxnewswill bruce ohr, whose family received big money for helping to create the phony, dirty and discredited dossier, ever be fired from the jeff sessions “justice” department? a total jokeeverybody wants to keep their security clearance, it’s worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan it certainly isn’t because of the good job he did he is a political “hack”i hope john brennan, the worst cia director in our country’s history, brings a lawsuit it will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt he won’t suewhere’s the collusion? they made up a phony crime called collusion, and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed) if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt, they scream obstructionlooking for trouble they are enjoying ruining people’s lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side - the lies, the firings, the deleted emails and soooo much more mueller’s angry dems are looking to impact the election they are a national disgracedisgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over 30 hours with the white house councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someonestudy the late joseph mccarthy, because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby rigged witch huntsome members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times they actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward from the day i announced, the times has been fake news, and with their disgusting new board member, it will only get worsethe failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president, when in fact it is just the opposite - the two fake reporters knew this this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people so bad for americano collusion and no obstruction, except by crooked hillary and the democrats all of the resignations and corruption, yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction what about the brennan, comey, mccabe, strzok lies to congress, or crooked’s emailsand have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close so many lives have been ruined over nothing - mccarthyism at its worst yet mueller his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - media is even worsethe failing @nytimes wrote a fake piece today implying that because white house councel don mcgahn was giving hours of testimony to the special councel, he must be a john dean type “rat” but i allowed him and all others to testify - i didn’t have to i have nothing to hidei allowed white house counsel don mcgahn, and all other requested members of the white house staff, to fully cooperate with the special counsel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion, no obstruction witch huntthe united states has ended the ridiculous 230 million dollar yearly development payment to syria saudi arabia and other rich countries in the middle east will start making payments instead of the us i want to develop the us, our military and countries that help usthe economy is stronger and better than ever before importantly, there remains tremendous potential - it will only get better with timegreat job rachel campos-duffy on @foxandfriendshas anyone looked at the mistakes that john brennan made while serving as cia director? he will go down as easily the worst in history since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our countryall of the fools that are so focused on looking only at russia should start also looking in another direction, china but in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyonetoo many voices are being destroyed, some good some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen who is making the choices, because i can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made let everybody participate, good bad, and we will all just have to figure it outcensorship is a very dangerous thing absolutely impossible to police if you are weeding out fake news, there is nothing so fake as cnn msnbc, yet i do not ask that their sick behavior be removed i get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don’t watch at allsocial media is totally discriminating against republicaconservative voices speaking loudly and clearly for the trump administration, we won’t let that happen they are closing down the opinions of many people on the right, while at the same time doing nothing to othersfinancial gain is a federal gratuity statute violation, bribery statute violation, honest services violationall major crimesbecause the doj is run by blank jeff sessions” gregg jarrett so when does mueller do what must be done? probably never @foxnews“bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy, it’s astonishing that he’s still employed bruce nelly ohr’s bank account is getting fatter fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling he doesn’t disclose it under fed regs

exposed” charles payne @foxbusiness how much more does mueller have to see? they have blinders on - riggedi say andrew’s was a bigger and more incompetent blunder he should easily win his race against a super liberal actress, but his political career is overwhich is worse, hightax andrew cuomo's statement, “we’re not going to make america great again, it was never that great” or hillary clinton’s “deplorables” statementwhen a politician admits that “we’re not going to make america great again,” there doesn’t seem to be much reason to ever vote for him this could be a career threatening statement by andrew cuomo, with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother chriswow big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about america’s lack of greatness i have already made america great again, just look at the markets, jobs, military- setting records, and we will do even better andrew “choked” badly, mistakethe us has more

collusion on the democrats side-podesta, dossier?is robert mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to president trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty contentious business relationship, i turned him down to head the fbi (one day before appointment as sc) comey is his close friendthere is no collusion the robert mueller rigged witch hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an obama white house lawyer) angry democrats, was started by a fraudulent dossier, paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc therefore, the witch hunt is an illegal

cover it up, our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people as an example, the failing new york timesaccurately 90% of media coverage of my administration is negative, despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving, it’s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low i will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-trump haters in thewhen the media - driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk very unpatriotic freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the newsi would be willing to “shut down” government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security, which includes the wall must get rid of lottery, catch release etc and finally go to system of immigration based on merit we need great people coming into our countrythe biggest and

retained bill and crooked hillary’s lawyer gee, i wonder if they helped him make the choice,the only collusion with russia was with the democrats, so now they are looking at my tweets (along with 53

of a lawyer would tape a client? so sad is this a first, never heard of it before? why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while i was presumably saying positive things? i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? too badchina is targeting our farmers, who they know i love respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the us they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt we were being nice - until now china made $517 billion on us last yearwhen you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity negotiations are going really well, be cool the end result will be worth itevery time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs, i wonder, what can they be thinking? are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? lost $817 billion on trade last year no weakness“the russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton frame donald trump” is a hot seller, already number one more importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly congratulations to gregg jarrettso sad and unfair that the fcc wouldn’t approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not sinclair

country is doing great best financial numbers on the planet great to have usa winning againtoday is the day to vote for brian kemp will be great for georgia, full endorsement tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with tariffs it’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking remember, we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed all will be greatcountries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago but, as the saying goes, better late than never#madeinamerica showcase lou barletta was one of my first supporters he is tough on crime and borders will be a great senator from pennsylvania his opponent is weak on crime, ice and borders we need lou robert will do a great job for our vets we also recently won choice in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for amazon is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the us supreme court two months ago next up is the us post office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their “delivery boy” for a big percentage of their packagesa rocket has not been launched by north korea in 9 months likewise, no nuclear tests japan is happy, all of asia is happy but the fake news is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that i am angry because it is not going fast enough wrong, very happywhen you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin, and all that i gave up, remember, i gave up nothing, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the corrupt media”carter page wasn’t a spy, wasn’t an agent of the russians - he would have cooperated with the fbi it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump” tom fitton @judicialwatch a disgrace to america they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt nowand the doj, fbi and obama gang need to be held to account source #1 was the major source avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team not about carter pagewas all about getting trump“it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team this is a clinton campaign document it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trumpso we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty

witch hunttom fitton on @foxandfriends at 6:15 am now judicial watchto iranian president rouhani: never, ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few

the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch huntlooking more more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of crooked

angry democrats, who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats, want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doingthe rigged witch hunt, headed by the 13 angry democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for obama wh), seems intent on damaging the republican party’s chances in the november election this democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 election never endsinconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of perhaps illegal the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrongthe nfl national anthem debate is alive and well

kneeling, out for seasono payi got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin in the old days they would call it diplomacy if i was loud vicious, i would have been criticized for being too tough remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim? hypocritesso important should have been done years ago farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years

dairy farmers will winthe united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well tightening now hurts all that we have done the us should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals debt coming due we are raising rates - really?china, the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the us is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge as usual, not a level playing fieldmy deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri such a tragedy, such a great loss may god be with you allwill the dems and fake news ever learn?

these problemsbut they can all be solvedthe summit with russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the fake news media i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for israel, nucleari told you so the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies, google they truly have taken advantage of the us, but not for longreally big jobs meeting today at the white house 3 pm“trump recognized russian meddling many times” thank you to @foxandfriends and @foxnews for actually showing the clips the fake news wants no part of that narrative too bad they don’t want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being setthe fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that i’ll probably have a good relationship with putin we are doing much better than any other countrythe fake news media is going crazy they make up stories without any backup, sources or proof many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity but i’ll complain anywaythe democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ice this should cost them heavily in the midterms yesterday, the republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting icethank you to novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs likewise to pfizer we are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugsa total disgrace that turkey will not release a

start coming to fruitionsome people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia they would rather go to war than see this it’s called trump derangement syndrome“a lot of democrats wished they voted for the tax cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again” @foxandfriends @kilmeadecongratulations to martha roby of the great state of alabama on her big gop primary win for congress my endorsement came appropriately late, but when it came the “flood gates” opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve enjoyrussia has agreed to help with north korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along there is no rush, the sanctions remain big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of processwhile the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success many positive things will come out of that meetingso many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in helsinki putin and i discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting we got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match big results will come“prosperity is returning donald trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate, now as the most effective president, the most successful president, in modern american history” thank you to the great lou dobbsthe democrats want to abolish ice, which will mean more crime in our country i want to give ice a big cheer vote republican in novemberthe meeting between president putin and myself was a great success, except in the fake news mediathe economy of the united states is stronger than ever beforethank you @randpaul “the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed to think?”while i had a great meeting with nato, raising vast amounts of money, i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia sadly, it is not being reported that way - the fake news is going crazyi had a great meeting with nato they have paid $33 billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future, only because of me nato was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for russia) the media only says i was rude to leaders, never mentions the moneywill be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9pme and @tuckercarlson tomorrow night at 8pme enjoya productive dialogue is not only good for the united states and good for russia, but it is good for the world #helsinki2018 i would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace, than to risk peace in pursuit of politics #helsinki2018 as i said today and many times before, “i have great confidence in my intelligence people” however, i also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past – as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along #helsinki2018thank you helsinki, finland joint press conference from helsinki, finland: it was an honor to join you this morning thank you our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of us foolishness and stupidity and now, the rigged witch huntpresident obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, did nothing about it when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzokreceived many calls from leaders of nato countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present future we had a truly great summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media nato is now strong richcongratulations to france, who played extraordinary soccer, on winning the 2018 world cup additionally, congratulations to president putin and russia for putting on a truly great world cup tournament -- one of the best everknow how to do is resist and obstruct this is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country – but at some point, it will healover the years, i would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that i should have gotten saint petersburg in addition much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the demsheading to helsinki, finland – looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow unfortunately, no matter how well i do at the summit, if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russiathere hasn’t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in north korea, there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isn’t the fake news talking about these wonderful facts? because it is fake newsthese russian individuals did their work during the obama years why didn’t obama do something about it? because he thought crooked hillary clinton would win, that’s why had nothing to do with the trump administration, but fake news doesn’t want to report the truth, as usualour prayers are with those affected by the flooding in japan we commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones remember, it was little jeff z and his people, who are told exactly what to say, who said i could not win the election in that “there was no way to 270” (over over again) in the electoral college i got 306 they were sooooo wrong in their election coverage still hurtingso funny i just checked out fake news cnn, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of jim acosta (actually a nice guy) they didn’t but they did say i already lost in my meeting with putin fake newsthe stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration, not the trump administration why didn’t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september, before the election?where is the dnc server, and why didn’t the fbi take possession of it? deep state?the stock market hit 25,000 yesterday jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government it is all happeningi have arrived in scotland and will be at trump turnberry for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf - my primary form of exercise the weather is beautiful, and this place is

paying russia, the country they want protection from, billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia not acceptable all nato nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia they pay only a fraction of their cost the us pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe, and loses big on tradeas i head out to a very important nato meeting, i see that fbi loveagent lisa page is dodging a subpoena is refusing to show up and testify what can she possibly say about her statements and lies so much corruption on the other side where is the attorney general? @foxnewsbillions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn’t nearly enough us spends too much europe’s borders are bad pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptablehow can the rigged witch hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former fbi agenlover peter strzok? read his hate filled and totally biased emails and the answer is clearex-fbi layer lisa page today defied a house of representatives issued subpoena to testify before congress wow, but is anybody really surprised together with her lover, fbi agent peter strzok, she worked on the rigged witch hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case everif the democrats want to win supreme court and other court picks, don’t obstruct and resist, but rather do it the good ol’ fashioned way, win electionswhat good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? the us is paying for europe’s protection, then loses billions on trade must pay 2% of gdp immediately, not by 2025democrats in congress must no longer obstruct - vote to fix our terrible immigration laws now i am watching what is going on from europe - it would be soooo simple to fix judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works they are just using childrenthings up, better than ever before, but it can’t go too quickly i am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will wini am in brussels, but always thinking about our farmers soy

for this decision and hope other companies do the same great news for the american peoplethe european union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in europe (us has a $151 billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through nato, and nicely pay for it just doesn’t worka recent emerson college epoll said that most americans, especially

drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and bob mueller, the leader of the 13 angry democrats on a witch hunt, knows? isn’t this highly illegal is it being investigated?“director david lynch: trump could go down as one of the greatest presidents” surprised that harley-davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the white flag i fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the eu, which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 billion taxes just a harley excuse - be patient #magacongresswoman maxine waters, an extraordinarily low iq

facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under obama fake news is working overtimei have tried to stay uninvolved with the department of justice and fbi (although i do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive witch hunt currently going on but you do have to ask why the doj fbi aren’t giving over requested documents?the red hen

very dangerous trip, and only 2000 are with their parents, many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasionsdemocrats are the problem they don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our country, like ms-13 they can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential votersif you don’t have borders, you don’t have a countrycrime in germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted others countries are even worse be smart americai can’t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election” inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election a rigged witch huntpcomey gave strozk his marching orders mueller is comey’s best friend witch huntif president obama (who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have, the fake news would have named him a national heroit is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration change the lawschange the lawschildren are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border it is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world not going to happen in the uswe don’t want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with usthe people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition crime in germany is way up big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culturewhy don’t the democrats give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including ms-13, coming into our country illegally?“the highest level of bias i’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer” trey gowdy on the fbi’s own, peter strzok also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller a really sick deal, isn’t it?the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security safety don’t wait until after the election because you are going to losewhy was the fbi’s sick loser, peter strzok, working on the totally discredited mueller team of 13 angry conflicted democrats, when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer lisa page, that “we’ll stop” trump from becoming president? witch huntwhy was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media they are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people fake news, they put their own spin on it - truth doesn’t matter to themwitch hunt there was no russian collusion oh, i see, there was no russian collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax too bad they didn’t look at crooked hillary like this double standardwashington post employees want to go on strike because bezos isn’t paying them enough i think a really long strike would be a great idea employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time is @wapo a registered lobbyist?our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been companies doing really well, and moving back to america, and jobs numbers are the best in 44 yearsthe denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia they are so happy over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions millions of livesholding back the “war games” during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation also, quite provocative can start up immediately if talks break down, which i hope will not happenfunny how the fake news, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i “met” that’s because that’s all they have to disparage we got so much for peace in the world, more is being added in finals even got our hostageremainsdaniel henninger of the wall street journal: “this ig report makes it clear, as did rod rosenstein’s memo, that trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing jim comey so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now” witch huntplease clear up the fake news chuck schumer said “the summit was what the texans call all cattle and no hat” thank you chuck, but are you sure you got that right? no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites hostages already back, hero remains coming home much morethe ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, peter strzok and lisa page, who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american historymy supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country as we get stronger, so does our country best numbers everdemocrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation, for a change this is why we need more republicans elected in november democrats are good at only three things, high taxes, high crime and obstruction sadgreat discussions with european union commission president jean-claude juncker and eu council president donald tusk at the #g7summit in canada last week the fake news media said that i did not get along with other leaders at the #g7summit in canada they are once again, wrong i have a great relationship with angela merkel of germany, but the fake news media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where i am asking for things that no other american president would ask for i’ve had to beat 17 very talented people including the bush dynasty, then i had to beat the clinton dynasty, and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig reportand never forget the fake news media it never endswow, what a tough sentence for paul manafort, who has represented ronald reagan, bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns didn’t know manafort was the head of the mob what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others? very unfairthe democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall, end catch release, visa lottery and chain, and go to merit based immigration go for it win“donald trump was 100% right to fire james comey” mark levin“why in the world didn’t barack obama fire this guy (comey)?” asks mark levinwow, the highest rated (by far) morning show, @foxandfriends, is on the front lawn of the white house maybe i’ll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?usa jobs numbers are the best in 44 years if my opponent (the democrats) had won the election, they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy, and jobs, would have been a disasterthank you for all of the compliments on getting the world cup to come to the usa, mexico and canada i worked hard on this, along with a great team of talented people we never fail, and it will be a great world cup a special thanks to bob kraft for excellent advicethe ig report is a total disaster for comey, his minions and sadly, the fbi comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the fbi i did a great service to the people in firing him good instincts christopher wray will bring it proudly backfbi agent peter strzok, who headed the clinton russia investigations, texted to his lover lisa page, in the ig report, that “we’ll stop” candidate trump from becoming president doesn’t get any lower than thathappy #flagday🇺🇸 happy 243rd birthday to the @usarmy thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, and dedication to the usa we love you schneiderman, who ran the clinton campaign in new york, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settlethe sleazy new york democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) ag eric schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000 i won’t settle this caseso, the democrats make up a phony crime, collusion with the russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (comey) classified information so that a special councel will be appointed, and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake newsnow that i am back from singapore, where we had a great result with respect to north korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the witch hunt, always remembering that there was no collusion and no obstruction of the fabricated no crimethe

worker firstgreat to be in singapore, excitement in the airgermany pays 1% (slowly) of gdp towards nato, while we pay 4% of a much larger gdp does anybody believe that makes sense? we protect europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on trade change is comingand add to that the fact that the us pays close to the entire cost of nato-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh) the european union had a $151 billion surplus-should pay much more for militarywhy should i, as president of the united states, allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses, as they have for decades, while our farmers, workers taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? not fair to the people of america $800 billion trade deficitfair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal according to a canada release, they make almost 100 billion dollars in trade with us

to give a news conference after i left saying that, “us tariffs were kind of insulting” and he “will not be pushed around” very dishonest weak our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairybased on justin’s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our us farmers, workers and companies, i have instructed our us reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the us market…create peace and great prosperity for his land i look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity

listed by the 13 angry democrats (plus) working on the witch hunt hoax there has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted it is all a democrat excuse for losing the election

kneeling sorrybig supreme court ruling for baker just outin many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a jobthe fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt#500days of american greatness: the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional despite that, we play the game because i, unlike the democrats, have done nothing wrongfarmers have not been doing well for 15 years mexico, canada, china and others have treated them unfairly by the time i finish trade talks, that will change big trade barriers against us farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken massive trade deficits no longerthe us has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only winchina already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products not acceptableas has been stated by numerous legal scholars, i have the absolute right to pardon myself, but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong? in the meantime, the never ending witch hunt, led by 13 very angry and conflicted democrats (others) continues into the mid-terms“this is the best time ever to look for a job” james freeman of wsjwe had repeal replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway individual mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month drug prices coming down right to trythis is my 500th day in office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any president in his first 500 days massive tax regulation cuts, military vets, lower crime illegal immigration, stronger borders, judgeships, best economy jobs ever, and much moremark penn “why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff? why is there an independent counsel? to go after people and their families for unrelated offensesconstitution was set up to prevent thisstormtrooper tactics almost” a disgracepaul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented ronald reagan, bob dole many others over the years), but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn’t have been hiredas only one of two people left who could become president, why wouldn’t the fbi or department of “justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? should have told mejesse watters “the only thing trump obstructed was hillary getting to the white house” so truewhen you’re almost 800 billion dollars a year down on trade, you can’t lose a trade war the us has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade, time to get smartwhy is it that the wall street journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the us by other countries, or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into us coffers?the united states must, at long last, be treated fairly on trade if we charge a country zero to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated that is not free or fair trade, it is stupid tradethere was no collusion with russia (except by the democrats) when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end? so bad for our country is the special counsejustice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media? should be looking at dems corruption instead?real @foxnews is doing great, fake news cnn is dead very surprised that china would be doing this? now this is a record that will never be broken “$17 million spent, it’s a scam investigation americans are being worked we now know there was russian collusion, with russians and the democrats the mueller team is stacked with anti-trumpers, who actually represented clinton people (gave $’s to crooked h)” dan bongino“john brennan, no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar not only is he a liar, he’s a liar about being a liar” dan bongino on @foxandfriends“we ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are” neil irwin of the @nytimestoday, it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the united states coast guard canada has treated our

surplus on trade with us do timber lumber in us?looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morningwhy aren’t they firing no talent samantha bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? a total double standard but that’s ok, we are winning, and will be doing so for a long time to comeap has just reported that the russian hoax investigation has now cost our

good meetings with north koreanot that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not truethe corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, spies (informants), into my campaign surveillance much?iger, where is my call of apology? you and abc have offended millions of people, and they demand a response how is brian ross doing? he tanked the market with an abc lie, yet no apology double standardrush limbaugh “if the fbi was so concerned, and if they weren’t targeting trump, they should have told trump if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? why not tell trump? because they were pushing this scam”“the recusal of jeff sessions was an unforced betrayal of the president of the united states” joe digenova, former us attorneythe soon to be released book, “the russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump,” written by gregg jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see out in 5 weeksvery importantly, @repdandonovan will win for the republicans in novemberand his opponent will not remember alabama we can’t take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democratthere is no one better to represent the people of ny and staten island (a place i know very well) than @repdandonovan, who is strong on borders crime, loves our military our vets, voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again dan has my full endorsementgreat meeting with @kimkardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing moments ago, it was my great honor to sign #righttotry into

valerie jarrett to let her know that “abc does not tolerate comments like those” made by roseanne barr gee, he never called president donald j trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on abc maybe i just didn’t get the call?the failing and corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at “1000 people,” when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin’ this is the way they demean and disparage they are very dishonest people who don’t “get” me, and never didthere are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else” and i wish i didchief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, ‘oh by the way i’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, i would be frustrated tooand that’s how i read that - senator sessions, why didn’t you tell me before i picked youreptrey gowdy, “i don’t think so, i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward if i were the president and i picked someone to be the country’sthe fake mainstream media has, from the time i announced i was running for president, run the most highly sophisticated dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics no matter how well we do, they find fault but the forgotten men women won, i’m presidentsorry, i’ve got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear, bad trade deals, va choice, the economy, rebuilding the military, and so much more, and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clintorussifbjusticobamcomelynch etcwhy aren’t the 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton it’s a rigged witch hunt, that’s why ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebrationthe 13 angry democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for obama) working on the rigged russia witch hunt, will be meddling with the mid-term elections, especially now that republicans (stay tough) are taking the lead in polls there was no collusion, except by the democrats“this investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about it wasn’t just a wiretap against a campaign aideit was secretly gathering information on the trump campaignpeople call that spyingthis is unprecedented and scandalous” mollie hemingwaywe have put a great team together for our talks with north korea meetings are currently taking place concerning summit, and more kim young chol, the vice chairman of north korea, heading now to new york solid response to my letter, thank youdemocrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from obama’s term showing children from the border in steel cages they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of countrybipartisan billcalifornia has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others on june 5th, vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox, a really good and highly competent man he’ll make california great againa democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts (no chance) this is too good to be true for republicansremember, the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime, the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms-13 gang membersnot goodour fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny they saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served they cared for their families more than anything in the world, they loved their families they inspired their communities the heroes who rest in these hallowed fields, in cemeteries, battlefields, and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of american life they came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies, from privilege and from poverty thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance we are gathered here on the sacred soil of @arlingtonnatl cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of america's greatest heroes, the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom #memorialday “we now find out that the obama administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation that raises legitimate questions i just find this really oddthis goes to the heart of our electoral system” jonathan turley on @foxnews“sally yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the justice dept i find her actions to be really quite unbelievable” jonathan turley“the president deserves some answers” @foxnews in discussing “spygate”happy memorial day those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and hispanics ever (women in 18years), rebuilding our military and so much more nice#memorialday🇺🇸 why didn’t president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election? because he thought crooked hillary was going to win, and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart he was in charge, not me, and did nothingour united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day kim jong un agrees with me on this it will happenwhy didn’t the 13 angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton, many crimes, much collusion with russia? why didn’t the fbi take the server from the dnc? rigged investigationfantastic to have 400,000 great men women of rolling thunder in dc showing their patriotism they love our country, they love our flag, they stand for our national anthem thanks to executive director artie mullerwho’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt? they journeyed down to washington, dc, with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nationthey went back home in tatterswelcome home josh when will the 13 angry democrats (those who worked for president o), reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest? it’s been a long time now will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems, justice, fbi russia?this whole russia probe is rigged just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven’t been lost in decades 13 angry democrats, and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years #spygate conflicts of interestwith spies, or “informants” as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the fbi or “justice” contact me to tell me of the phony russia problem?the failing @nytimes quotes “a senior white house official,” who doesn’t exist, as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on june 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed” wrong again use real people, not phony sourcesunlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe, there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to how to deal with north koreaand if there was, it wouldn’t matter the @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginningthanks to very brave teacher hero jason seaman of noblesville, indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the worldlooking forward to seeing joshua holt this evening in the white house the great people of utah are celebratingput pressure on the democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the border into the us catch and release, lottery and chain must also go with it and we must continue building the wall democrats are protecting ms-13 thugsgood news about the release of the american hostage from venezuela should be landing in dc this evening and be in the white house, with his family, at about 7:00 pm the great people of utah will be very happywe are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in singapore on the same date, june 12th, and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that datebut complain and obstruct they made only bad deals (iran) and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the worldsenator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase us parts and pay a $13 billion fine dems do nothingfunny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states lost almost $800 billioyear under “o”chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job the killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fastthe killings must stopto the @navalacademy class of 2018, i say: we know you are up to the task we know you will make us proud we know that glory will be yours because you are winners, you are warriors, you are fighters, you are champions, and you will lead us to victory

maryland congratulations good luck godspeed and anchors aweigh very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea we will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace only time (and talent) will telldemocrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals must be nurtured, or asking to end your big tax cuts raise your taxes instead dems have lost touch“everyone knows there was a spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spywidespread spying involving multiple people” mollie hemingway, the federalist senior editor but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster storycan anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? and to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, lostthe democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a spy, as illegal as that may be but what about an “informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the russian hoax?today, it was my great honor to present the #medalofhonor to @usnavy (seal) master chief special warfare operator britt slabinski in the east room of the @whitehouse full ceremony: today, it was my honor to sign #s2155, the i have decided to terminate the planned summit in singapore on june 12th while many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, i believe that this is a tremendous setback for north korea and indeed a setback for the world it was my great honor to host a roundtable re: ms-13 yesterday in bethpage, new york democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can support law enforcement and save innocent lives sadly, i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jong un not surprisingly, the great men women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey, mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi #spygateclapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign large dollars were paid to the spy, far beyond normal starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in us history spygate - a terrible thingwill be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 am enjoygreat to be in new york for the day heading back to the @whitehouse now, lots of work to be done thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in bethpage, new york keep up the great work crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled ms-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and democrats in congress refuse to close these loopholes, including the disgraceful practice known as catch-and-release democrats must abandon their resistance today on long island, we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of ms-13 i was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the state of the union thank you @sbalist #sbagala witch huntthere will be big news coming soon for our great american autoworkers after many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enoughbig legislation will be signed by me shortly after many years, right to try and big changes to dodd frankour trade deal with china is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion“trump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaign” no, james clapper, i am not happy spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to booteverybody is with tomi lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman @foxandfriendsspygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history“it’s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump campaign” judge andrew napolitanolook how things have turned around on the criminal deep state they go after phony collusion with russia, a made up scam, and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before what goes around, comes around@foxandfriends “new bombshell in the obama spying scandal did other agencies spy on trump campaign?” even clapper, worlds dumbest former intelligence head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word spy when describing the illegal activitiesfollow the money the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia, because there was no collusion he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders, who got dupedif the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normalfor the first time since roe v wade, america has a pro-life president, a pro-life vice president, a pro-life house of representatives and 25 pro-life republican state capitals it was my honor to welcome @nascar cup series champion @martintruex_jr and his team to the @whitehouse yesterday today, it was my great honor to welcome president moon jae-in of the republic of korea to the @whitehouse🇺🇸🇰🇷 @asahutchinson, the great governor of arkansas, is in a primary tomorrow he has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes, border security, and crime prevention asa loves our military and our veterans i fully endorse asa for governorunder our potential deal with china, they will purchase from our great american farmers practically as much as our farmers can producethe wall street journal asks, “where in the world was barack obama?” a very good questionthey then used to start an investigation about trump it is that simple this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle this was a political hit job, this was not an intelligence investigation brennan has disgraced himself, he’s worried about staying out of jail” dan bonginotop of the fbi brennan started this entire debacle about president trump we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) dossierhe knows about the dossier, he denies knowledge of the dossier, he briefs the gang of 8 on the hill about the dossier, which“john brennan is panicking he has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the country, he has disgraced the entire intelligence community he is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of american’s faith in the intelligence community and in some people at thechina must continue to be strong tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in i want this to happen, and north korea to be very successful, but only after signingon china, barriers and tariffs to come down for first timechina has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional faragricultural products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many yearsi ask senator chuck schumer, why didn’t president obama the democrats do something about trade with china, including theft of intellectual property etc? they did nothing with that being said, chuck i have long agreed on this issue fair trade, plus, with china will happeni hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbdoj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administrationthe witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the world oh’ greatand why hasn’t the podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington, dc?what ever happened to the server, at the center of so much corruption, that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of democrats) fbi? they broke into homes offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the server?now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world, they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party don’t worry about dems fisa abuse, missing emails or fraudulent dossierin the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33,000 emails, got $145,000,000 while secretary of state, paid mccabes wife $700,000 (and got off the fbi hook along with terry m) and so much more republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scamat what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 witch hunt, composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years, stop they have found no collussion with russia, no obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruptionthings are really getting ridiculous the failing and crooked (but not as crooked as hillary clinton) @nytimes has done a long boring story indicating that the world’s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia me so now they are looking at the rest of the worldif the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee (also, senate judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers drain the swampgreat to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house melania is feeling and doing really well thank you for all of your prayers and best wisheshappy #armedforcesday to our great military men and women for their selfless service to our nation america is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance,

one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes john cox is the man - he’ll be the best governor you’ve ever had i fully endorse john cox for governor and look forward to working with him to make california great againjust met with un secretary-general antónio guterres who is working hard to “make the united nations great again” when the un does more to solve conflicts around the world,

not looking good god bless allreports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president it took place very early on, and long before the phony russia hoax became a “hot” fake news story if true - all time biggest political scandalwhy isn’t disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700,000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia, led by clinton best friend terry m (under fbi investigation that they killed) gave to mccabe’s wife in her run for office? then dropped case on clintonfake news media had me calling immigrants, or illegal immigrants, “animals” wrong they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories i referred to ms 13 gang members as “animals,” a big difference - and so true fake news got it purposely wrong, as usual“apparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign this has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn’t commit” david asman @loudobbs @greggjarrett really bad stuffit was my great honor to visit with our heroes last night at walter reed medical center there is nobody like them tomorrow, the

the most successful first 17 month administration in us history - by far sorry to the fake news media and “haters,” but that’s the way it iswow, word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi “spied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant” andrew mccarthy says, “there’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign” if so, this is bigger than watergatecongratulations america, we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american historyand there is still no collusion and no obstruction the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more moneygina haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the cia she is exceptionally qualified and the senate should confirm her immediately we need her to keep our great country safe #confirmginaand voted against the massive tax cut bill he’s also weak on borders and crime sadly, our great military

private agreement money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transactionvery common among celebrities and people of wealth in this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in arbitration for damages against ms clifford (daniels) the agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,mr cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or nda these agreements areour great financial team is in china trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade i look forward to being with president xi in the not too

granted to the presidency and get involvednew book - a must read “the russia hoax - the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump” by the brilliant fox news legal analyst gregg jarrett a sad chapter for law enforcement a rigged system“the questions are an intrusion into the president’s article 2 powers under the constitution to fire any executive branch employeewhat the president was thinking is an outrageousas to the president’s unfettered power to fire anyone” joe digenova, former us attorneythere was no collusion (it is a hoax) and there is no obstruction of

will all get done great potential for usaso disgraceful that the questions concerning the russian witch hunt were “leaked” to the media no questions on collusion oh, i seeyou have a made up, phony crime, collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information nicethe white house is running very smoothly despite phony witch hunts etc there is great energy and unending stamina, both necessary to get things done we are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so fake news is going “bonkers”the fake news is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist) they are totally unhinged, and the great success of this administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying truly bad peopleduring small business week, we celebrate the great, hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small businessthe migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak ineffective us immigration laws are yet democrats like jon tester continue to support the open borders agenda – tester even voted to protect sanctuary cities we need lawmakers who will put america firsti recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of congressional term limits i gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts #draintheswampnumerous countries are being considered for the meeting, but would peace housfreedom house, on the border of north

closure, no more testing“gop lawmakers asking sessions to investigate comey and hillary clinton” @foxnews good luck with that request“at least two memos comey shared with a friend contained classified information” wall street journalthe washington post said i refer to jeff sessions as “mr magoo” and rod rosenstein as “mr peepers” this is “according to people with whom the president has spoken” there are no such people and don’t know these charactersjust more fake disgusting news to create ill willjames comey’s memos are classified, i did not declassify them they belong to our government therefore, he broke the law additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said i said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker where are memos on clinton, lynch others?sylvester stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson his trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, i am considering a full pardonso funny, the democrats have sued the republicans for winning now he r’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material,

businessman for his own accounlawyer who i have always liked respected most people will flip if the government lets them out of trouble, even ifthe new york times and a third rate reporter named maggie haberman, known as a crooked h flunkie who i don’t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy michael cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will “flip” they usea message from kim jong un: “north korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles” also will “shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests” progress being made for alljames comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special council? therefore, the special council was established based on an illegal act? really, does everybody know what that means?just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi, the debbie wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emailsnorth korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site this is very good news for north korea and the world - big progress look forward to our summitcan you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the fake news media (should be getting good stories), today we had just about our highest poll numbers, including those on election day? the american public is wise to the phony an dishonest press make america great againlooks like opec is at it again with record amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, oil prices are artificially very high no good and will not be acceptednancy pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big tax cuts given to the american people by the republicansgot not one democrat vote here’s a choice they want to end them and raise your taxes substantially republicans are working on making them permanent and more cutsso exciting i have agreed to be the commencement speaker at our great naval academy on may 25th in annapolis, maryland looking forward to being thereso general michael flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while shadey james comey can leak and lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written) is that really the way life in america is supposed to work? i don’t think sojames comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction also, he leaked classified information wow will the witch hunt continue?james comey just threw andrew mccabe “under the bus” inspector general’s report on mccabe is a disaster for both of them getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?sanctuary cities released at least 142 gang members across the united states, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed we are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in america difficultmy thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of the two @gcsoflorida deputies (heroes) who lost their lives in the line of duty todaymike pompeo is outstanding first in his class at west point a top student at harvard law school a success at whatever he has done we need the senate to approve mike asap he will be a great secretary of statehopefully the senate will not leave washington until our ambassadors, judges and the people who make washington work are approved the democrats are obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our countrydemocrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our government, hence, the american people they are “slow walking” all of my nominations - hundreds of people at this rate it would take 9 years for all

@netanyahu and all of the people of israel on the 70th anniversary of your great independence we have no better friends anywhere looking forward to moving our embassy to jerusalem next monthslippery james comey, the worst fbi director in history, was not fired because of the phony russia investigation where, by the way, there was no collusion (except by the dems)mike pompeo met with kim jong un in north korea last week meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed details of summit are being worked out now denuclearization will be a great thing for world, but also for north koreaa sketch years later about a nonexistent man a total con job, playing the fake news media for fools (but they know it) there is a revolution going on in california soooo many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous, crime infested breeding concept jerry brown is trying to back out of the national guard at the border, but the people of the state are not happy want security safety nowwhile japan and south korea would like us to go back into tpp, i don’t like the deal for the united states too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for our workers look how bad wto is to uspastor andrew brunson, a fine gentleman and christian leader in the united states, is on trial and being persecuted in turkey for no reason they call him a spy, but i am more a spy than he is hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongsit is my great honor to host @jpn_pmo @abeshinzo @flotus melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush: states and cities throughout our country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers very unfair to traditional tax paying storescongress – house and senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society keep america safetoday’s court decision means that congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons this is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed bywelcome prime minister abe rasmussen just came out at 51% approval despite the fake news media they were one of the three most accurate on election day just about the most inaccurate were cnn and abc newwashington post, and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters) much of the media is a scamgetting ready to meet prime minister abe of japan, a truly fine gentlemanso many people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut bill everyone is talking, really nice to seelooks like jerry brown and california are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border he cannot come to terms for the national guard to patrol and protect the border the high crime rate will only get higher much wanted wall in san diego already startedi am in florida and looking forward to my meeting with prime minister abe of japan working on trade and military securityemployment is up, taxes are down enjoyrussia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the us keeps raising interest rates not acceptablecomey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in congress to senator g), then based his decisions on her poll numbers disgruntled, he, mccabe, and the others, committed many crimesjust hit 50% in the rasmussen poll, much higher than president obama at same point with all of the phony stories and fake news, it’s hard to believe thank you america, we are doing great thingsslippery james comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart), will go down as the worst fbi director in history, by farattorney client privilege is now a thing of the past i have many (too many) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken all lawyers are deflated and concernedi never asked comey for personal loyalty i hardly even knew this guy just another of his many lies his “memos” are self serving and fakethe syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term “mission accomplished” i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term, it should be brought back use oftencomey throws ag lynch “under the bus” why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch? was she promised a supreme court seat, or ag, in order to lay off hillary no golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)the big questions in comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up classified information (jail), why did he lie to congress (jail), why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi (why didn’t they take it), why the phony memos, mccabe’s $700,000 more?unbelievably, james comey states that polls, where crooked hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the clinton email probe in other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job slimeballso proud of our great military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our country has ever had there won’t be anything, or anyone, even closea perfectly executed strike last night thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military could not have had a better result mission accomplisheddoj just issued the mccabe report - which is a total disaster he lied lied lied mccabe was totally controlled by comey - mccabe is comey no collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifeswe are bringing back our factories, we are bringing back our jobs, and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: made in the usa untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible director of the fbi his handling of the crooked hillary clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history it was my great honor to fire james comeyjames comey is a proven leaker liar virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired he leaked classified information, for which he should be prosecuted he lied to congress under oath he is a weak andtremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities started the wall in san diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it they will soon be protectedwould only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres obama we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, japan, who has hit us hard on trade for yearsamerica’s greatest treasure is our people – and my administration hears your voice and has your back we are fighting to give every american a future of

seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question we are with you paulmuch of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake corrupt russia investigation, headed up by the all democrat loyalists, or people that worked for obama mueller is most conflicted of all (except rosenstein who signed fisa comey letter) no collusion, so they go crazyour relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the cold war there is no reason for this russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together stop the arms race?russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria get ready russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart” you shouldn’t be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys itdoing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation, which takes tremendous time

some are conflicted problem is that a newmuch can be done with the $16 billion given to building and fixing the border wall it is just a down payment work will start immediately the rest of the money will come - and remember daca, the democrats abandoned you (but we will not)because of the $700 $716 billion dollars gotten to rebuild our military, many jobs are created and our military is again

took another critical step to fulfill that commitment remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that donald trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as crooked hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff well, not saying that anymorecrazy joe biden is trying to act like a tough guy actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault he doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way don’t threaten people joedemocrats refused to take care of daca would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care i had to fight for military and start of wallgot $16 billion to start wall on southern border, rest will be forthcoming most importantly, got $700 billion to rebuild our military, $716 billion next yearmost ever had to waste money on dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipmentthey can help solve problems with north korea, syria, ukraine, isis, iran and even the coming arms race bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts” obama and clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember reset) peace through strengthi called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, obama called him also) the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him they are wrong getting along with russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing“special council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council i am still opposed to it i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council

agenda, probably at a later date same with lying james comey can we call them fake memos?wow, watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked “have you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous source?” he said strongly “never, no” he lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriendsthe mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc, and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign witch huntthe fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught, called out and fired how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by crooked h friend, terry m, who was also under investigation? how many lies? how many leaks? comey knew it all, and much moreas the house intelligence committee has concluded, there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign as many are now finding

won’t go thereproblem solved must be offensive, defense alone won’t workhistory shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes it takes police first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime highly trained, gun adept, teachercoaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive great deterrentimmediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this far more assets at much less cost than guards a “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people attacks would endi never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on fake news @cnn @nbc what i said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special

extraordinary law enforcement officers and first responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the medal of valor #americanheroes question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration, right up to january 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff sessionsthe great billy graham is dead there was nobody like him he will be missed by christians and all religions a very special man@cnn @msnbc whether we are republican or democrat, we must now focus on strengthening background checksso true, thank you bad ratings @cnn @msnbc got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall they probably knew it was fake news but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wisemain street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law cameras running another false accusation why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? one had her home mortgage paid off only @foxnews so reporteddoesn’t fit the mainstream media narrativea woman i don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago never happened who would do this in a public space with live securityi have been much tougher on russia than obama, just look at the facts total fake newshope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” congressional map, all the way to the supreme court, if necessary your original was correct don’t let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes waste moneymatt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event big difference from those days when president obama held the white house you’ve come a long way mattrepublicans are now leading the generic poll, perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially also, they want to do nothing on daca, r’s want to fixthe president obama quote just before election that’s because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat” when i easily won the electoral college, the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems“there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig america’s elections, there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so i’d invite mr trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes” thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia, including crimea, syria and so much more we are now starting to win again“the faith of donald trump,” a book just out by david brody and scott lamb, is a very interesting read enjoythe us economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving the unemployment numbers are looking great, and regulations taxes have been massively cut jobs, jobs, jobs@mittromney has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah he will make a great senator and worthy successor to @orrinhatch, and has my full support and endorsementobama was president up to, and beyond, the 2016 election so why didn’t he do something about russian meddling?have a great, but very reflective, president’s dayjust watched a very insecure oprah winfrey, who at one point i knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 minutes the questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the othersmy great friends from nascar are having their big race today, the daytona 500 brian france and the france family are special people enjoy the racethank you to kenstarr, former independent counsel, whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse, russian meddling etc really great interview with @mariabartiromogreat pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot big gain over last 4 weeks i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans, the cuts the dems want to take away we need more republicansthe fake news of big ratings loser cnn if it was the goal of russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the us then, with all of the committee hearings, investigations and party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams they are laughing their asses off in moscow get smart americanow that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats, lead by their fearless leader, crooked hillary clinton, lost the 2016 election but wasn’t i a great candidate?i never said russia did not meddle in the election, i said “it may be russia, or china or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer” the russian “hoax” was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never didfinally, liddle’ adam schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election he is finally right about something obama was president, knew of the threat, and did nothing thank you adamnever gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $17 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress, the fbi or justice called for an investigationgeneral mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h, the dnc and the dems remember the dirty dossier, uranium, speeches, emails and the podesta companyvery sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter this is not acceptable they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proudjust like they don’t want to solve the daca problem, why didn’t the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house senate during the obama administration because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk“i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goal” rob goldman vice president of facebook ads the fake news media never fails hard to ignore this fact from the vice president of facebook ads, rob goldman funny how the fake news media doesn’t want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for president maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn’t knowdeputy ag rod rosenstein stated at the news conference: “there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election“charges deal don a big win,” written by michael goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that “the russians had no impact on the election results” there was no collusion with the trump campaign “she lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate case closed”melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county, florida will never forget them, or the eveningour entire nation, one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims their families in parkland, fl to teachers, law enforcement, first responders medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: we thank you for your courage russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014, long before i announced that i would run for president the results of the election were not impacted the trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusioncannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democratstotally abandoned republicans are still working hardi will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered am also working with congress on many frontspresidential proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in parkland, florida: lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement, and a vote for open borders if dems are actually serious about daca, they should support the grassley billthe schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe @dhsgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in america” it creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn’t build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visain times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca, they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usaso many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem must always report such instances to authorities, again and againjust spoke to governor rick scott we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shootingmy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting no child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american schooltoday, i was honored to be joined by republicans and democrats from both the house and senate, as well as members of my cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore america’s depleted infrastructure as we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of african-americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all proclamation: negotiations on daca have begun republicans want to make a deal and democrats say they want to make a deal wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the daca puzzle this will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity march 5thour infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the democrats after many years we have taken care of our military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more bipartisan, make deal dems?the journey to #maga began @cpac 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something i look forward to every year see you at

@johnkasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @westervillepd this is a true tragedyrep lou barletta, a great republican from pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a fantastic senator he is strong smart, loves pennsylvania loves our country voted for tax cuts, unlike bob casey, who listened to tax hikers pelosi and schumer42 million hard working americans have already received a large bonus anor pay increase because of our recently passed tax cut jobs billand it will only get better we are far ahead of scheduleso many positive things going on for the usa and the fake news media just doesn’t want to go there same negative stories over and over again no wonder the people no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history #magamy administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans my thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @westervillepd republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do the dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about daca they only want to use it as a campaign issue vote republicanagencies, not just the fbi doj, now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election comey had conversations with donald trump, which i don’t believe were accuratehe leaked information (corrupt)” tom fitton of judicial watch on @foxnews“my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clintodnc dossier, it shows that he’s been victimized he’s been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts ofpeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation some are true and some are false some are old and some are new there is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone is there no such thing any longer as due process?according to the @nytimes, a russian sold phony secrets on “trump” to the us asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time i hope people are now seeing understanding what is going on here it is all now starting to come out - drain the swampthe democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency told them to re-do and send back in proper formjobless claims have dropped to a 45 year lowcosts on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the 2018 election, and beyond this bill is a big victory for our military, but much waste in order to get dem votes fortunately, daca not included in this bill, negotiations to start nowwithout more republicans in congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our military sadly, we needed some dem votes for passage

with an “a”-and likewise to doug schoen for the very good grade and statements working hardgreat to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border the dems just want

the senate, and they need 60 that is why we need to win more republicans in 2018 election we can then be even tougher on crime (and border), and even better to our military veteransthis is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present #democratshutdowndemocrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead #weneedmorerepublicansin18 in order to power through messnot looking good for our great military or safety security on the very dangerous southern border dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts, and what they are doing for our booming

little aboutchip should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 day, or short term, extensionwe need the wall for the safety and security of our country we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world if there is no wall, there is no dealwill be going to pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to rick saccone, running for congress in a special election (march 13) rick is a great guy we need more republicans to continue our already successful agendathe wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the us the $20 billion dollar wall is “peanuts” compared to what mexico makes from the us nafta is a bad jokethe wall is the wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or waterisis is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media we are making america great againdespite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters i respect and lots of good news for the american people to be proud ofand the fake news winners are main street is back strongest holiday sales bump since the great recession -- beating forecasts by billions of dollars during the campaign, i promised to make america great again by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country i am very proud to see companies like chrysler moving operations from mexico to michigan where there are so many great american workers i promised that my policies would allow companies like apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the united states great to see apple follow through as a result of tax cuts huge win for american workers and the usa today, we witnessed an incredible moment in history – the presentation of congress’ highest civilian honor to our friend, and true american hero, bob dole #congressionalgoldmedal eric trump on @foxandfriends nowwe need to keep america safe, including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-based new report from doj dhs shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born we have submitted to congress a list of resources and reformstoday, it was my honor to welcome president nursultan nazarbayev of kazakhstan to the @whitehouse “president donald j trump proclaims january 16, 2018, as religious freedom day” unemployment for black americans is the lowest ever recorded trump approval ratings with black americans has doubled thank you, and it will get even (much) better @foxnews“90% of trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived@foxandfriendsdo you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative the russian collusion hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the dems public gets itthe democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military, at a time we need it more than ever we need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now no more dangerous lotterywe must have security at our very dangerous southern border, and we must have a great wall to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our countrysenator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting deals can’t get made when there is no trust durbin blew daca and is hurting our militaryto stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do” my standard is very simple, america first make america great againstatement by me last night in florida: “honestly, i don’t think the democrats want to make a deal they talk about daca, but they don’t want to helpwe are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to they don’t want security at the border, they don’t wantbig unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible” (among many other things) “president trump reversed the policies of president obama, and reversed our economic decline” thank you stuart varney @foxandfriends“president trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy tax cut bonuses to more than 2,000,000 workers most explosive stock market rally that we’ve seen in modern times 18,000 to 26,000 from election, and grounded in profitability and growth all trump, not 0i, as president, want people coming into our country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on merit no more lotteries #america firstdaca is probably dead because the democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our militaryand they knew exactly what i said and meant they just wanted a story fake newsthe wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them “i have a good relationship with kim jong un” (of n korea) obviously i didn’t say that i said “i’d have a good relationship with kim jong un,” a big difference fortunately we now record conversations with reportersso much fake news is being reported they don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information the mainstream media is crazed that we won the electioni don’t believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca they are all talk and no action this is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have too badamerica firstthe democrats are all talk and no action they are doing nothing to fix daca great opportunity missed too badyesterday was a big day for the stock market jobs are coming back to america chrysler is coming back to the usa, from mexico and many others will follow tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing american business is hot againtoday, it was my great honor to proclaim january 15, 2018, as martin luther king jr, federal holiday i encourage all americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of dr king's life and legacy never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country never said “take them out” made up by dems i have a wonderful relationship with haitians probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trustsadly, democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for daca take care of our military, and our country, firstthe language used by me at the daca meeting was tough, but this was not the language used what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for dacabecause of the democrats not being interested in life and safety, daca has now taken a big step backwards the dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most get smart, make america great againcountries which are doing badly i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level i want safety and security for our people i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs i want to fund our military, not do a dem defundthe so-called bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards wall was not properly funded, chain lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crimereason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 12 billion dollars bad deal wanted me to cut ribbon-nothe democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border, risking thousands of lives in the process it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans we must build a great wall, think merit and end lottery chain usademocrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization very disrespectful to committee

you chrysler, a very wise decision the voters in michigan are very happy they voted for trumpence plenty of more to followmore great news as a result of historical tax cuts and reform: fiat chrysler

“donald trump is the greatest president our country has ever seen”yesterday, i signed the #interdictact (hr 2142) with bipartisan members of congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country together, we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the united states great news, as a result of our tax cuts jobs act with that being said, i have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land we need it get smart“45 year low in illegal immigration this year” @foxandfriends“house votes on controversial fisa act today” this is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the trump campaign by the previous administration and others?in new quinnipiac poll, 66% of people feel the economy is “excellent or good” that is the highest number ever recorded by this polldisproven and paid for by democrats “dossier used to spy on trump campaign did fbi use intel tool to influence the election?” @foxandfriends did dems or clinton also pay russians?

forward to the year ahead together, we are delivering results and making america great again the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues there was no collusion, everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion, yet on and on it goes russia the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing republicans should finally take controlthe fact that sneaky dianne feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trumrussia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace must have tough primaryit just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case (such as daca) always runs to the 9th circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts@icegov hsi agents and ero officers, on behalf of an entire nation, thank you for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow american’s safe

consequential presidency so much so that, despite my own frustration over his missteps, there has never been a day when i wished hillary clinton were president not one indeed, as trump’s

destroyed in his interview with stephen miller of the trump administration watch the hatred and unfairness of this cnn flunkyi’ve had to put up with the fake news from the first day i announced that i would be running for president now i have to put up with a fake book, written by a totally discredited author ronald reagan had the same problem and handled it well so will ileaving camp david for the white house great meetings with the cabinet and military on many very important subjects including border security the desperately needed wall, the ever increasing drug and opioid problem, infrastructure, military, budget, trade and dacato president of the united states (on my first try) i think that would qualify as not smart, but geniusand a very stable genius at thatactually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart crooked hillary clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames i went from very successful businessman, to top tv starnow that russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the american public, the democrats and their lapdogs, the fake news mainstream media, are taking out the old ronald reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligencebrian ross, the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the stock market down 350 points (billions of dollars), was suspended for a month but is now back at abc news in a lower capacity he is no longer allowed to report on trump should have been firedthe african american unemployment rate fell to 68%, the lowest rate in 45 years i am so happy about this news and, in the washington post (of all places), headline states, “trumps first year jobs numbers were very, very good”michael wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book he used sloppy steve bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job now sloppy steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone too bad good idea rand the mercer family recently dumped the leaker known as sloppy steve bannon smartwell, now that collusion with russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with hillary clinton and the fbrussia, the fake news media (mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at

that talks and dialogue would be going on between north and south korea right now if i wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total “might” against the north fools, but talks are a good thingas americans, you need identification, sometimes in a very strong and accurate form, for almost everything you doexcept when it comes to the most important thing, voting for the people that run your country push hard for voter identificationmany mostly democrat states refused to hand over data from the 2016 election to the commission on voter fraud they fought hard that the commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally system is rigged, must go to voter idmake america great againstock market had another good day but, now that the tax cut bill has passed, we have tremendous upward potential dow just short of 25,000, a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration also, unemployment went down to 41% only

washington (dc) today at 4:00 pm much work to be done, but it will be a great new yeariran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the obama administration the great iranian people have been repressed for many years they are hungry for food for freedom along with human rights, the wealth of iran is being looted time for changethe united states has foolishly given pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools they give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in afghanistan, with little help no morehappy new year we are making america great again, and much faster than anyone thought possibleas our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, i want to wish all

during the months since the election people are much better off now not to mention isis, va, judges, strong border, 2nd a, tax cuts more?if the dems (crooked hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on election day now they have a great future - and just beginning big protests in iran the people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism looks like they will not take it any longer the usa is watching very closely for human rights violations“trump rally: stocks put 2017 in the record books” jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the us unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically cut, and it will only get better much more to comei use social media not because i like to, but because it is the only way to fight a very dishonest and unfair “press,” now often referred to as fake news media phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever many stories reports a pure fictionon taxes: “this is the biggest corporate rate cut ever, going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years agothis is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy every year the obama wh overstated how the economy would grow now real economics and jobs” @wsj reportoppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice the world is watching the entire world understands that the good people of iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the united states, that iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most many reports of peaceful protests by iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad iranian govt should respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves the world is watching #iranproteststhe democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc we must protect our country at all costwhy is the united states post office,

stories hence my use of social media, the only way to get the truth out much of mainstream meadia has become a joke @foxandfriendsthe reason i originally endorsed luther strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election i was right roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against himcongratulations to doug jones on a hard fought

will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart? this issue is killing your leaguelavar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during thanksgiving with your son in china, but no nba contract to support you but remember lavar, shoplifting is not a little thing it’s a really big deal, especially in china ungrateful foolit wasn’t the white house, it wasn’t the state department, it wasn’t father lavar’s so-called people on the ground in china that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - it was me too bad lavar is just a poor man’s version of don king, but without the hair just thinktoday, we continued a wonderful american tradition at the white house drumstick and wishbone will live out their days in the beautiful blue ridge mountains at gobbler’s rest president donald j trump and @flotus melania participate in the pardoning of the national thanksgiving turkey at the white house under president trump unemployment rate will drop below 4% analysts predict

nfl should suspend him for remainder of season attendance and ratings way downrepublican senators are working very hard to get tax cuts and tax reform approved hopefully it will not be long and they do not want to disappoint the american publicborder patrol officer killed at southern border, another badly hurt we will seek out and bring to justice those responsible we will, and must, build the wallbig-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of elephants or any other animalshoplifting is a very big deal in china, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father lavar should have gotten his son out during my next trip to china instead china told them why they were released very ungratefulsen jeff flake(y), who is unelectable in the great state of arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite president he’ll be a no on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast”now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail, lavar ball, the father of liangelo, is unaccepting of what i did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal i should have left them in jailcrooked hillary clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time she just can’t stop, which is so good for the republican party hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three yearsput big game trophy decision on hold until such time as i review all conservation facts under study for years
