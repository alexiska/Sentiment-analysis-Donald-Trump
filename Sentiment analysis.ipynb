They made up a phony crime called Collusion, and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed) If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt, they scream Obstructionlooking for trouble They are enjoying ruining people’s lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side - the lies, the firings, the deleted Emails and soooo much more Mueller’s Angry Dems are looking to impact the election They are a National DisgraceDisgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someoneStudy the late Joseph McCarthy, because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby Rigged Witch HuntSome members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times They actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward From the day I announced, the Times has been Fake News, and with their disgusting new Board Member, it will only get worseThe Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President, when in fact it is just the opposite - the two Fake reporters knew this This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People So bad for AmericaNo Collusion and No Obstruction, except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats All of the resignations and corruption, yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction What about the Brennan, Comey, McCabe, Strzok lies to Congress, or Crooked’s Emailsand have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST Yet Mueller his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worseThe failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type “RAT” But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn’t have to I have nothing to hideI allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents Most transparent in history No Collusion, No Obstruction Witch HuntThe United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the US I want to develop the US, our military and countries that help usThe Economy is stronger and better than ever before Importantly, there remains tremendous potential - it will only get better with timeGreat Job Rachel Campos-Duffy on @foxandfriendsHas anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our countryAll of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China But in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyoneToo many voices are being destroyed, some good some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen Who is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made Let everybody participate, good bad, and we will all just have to figure it outCensorship is a very dangerous thing absolutely impossible to police If you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN MSNBC, yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don’t watch at allSocial Media is totally discriminating against RepublicaConservative voices Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won’t let that happen They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to othersfinancial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation, Bribery Statute Violation, Honest Services Violationall Major Crimesbecause the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions” Gregg Jarrett So when does Mueller do what must be done? Probably never @FoxNews“Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy, it’s astonishing that he’s still employed Bruce Nelly Ohr’s bank account is getting fatter fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling He doesn’t disclose it under Fed Regs Using your Federal office for personal“Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed” Charles Payne @FoxBusiness How much more does Mueller have to see?

And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOSTThe Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be But what about an “Informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the Russian Hoax?Today, it was my great honor to present the #MedalOfHonor to @USNavy (SEAL) Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse Full ceremony: Today, it was my honor to sign #S2155, the I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world It was my great honor to host a roundtable re: MS-13 yesterday in Bethpage, New York Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI #SPYGATEClapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in US history SPYGATE -

Minister Abe of Japan, a truly fine gentlemanSo many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill Everyone is talking, really nice to seeLooks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for

of the phony stories and Fake News, it’s hard to believe Thank you America, we are doing Great ThingsSlippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by farAttorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past I have many (too many) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken All lawyers are deflated and concernedI never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty I hardly even knew this guy Just another of his many lies His “memos” are self serving and FAKEThe Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term “Mission Accomplished” I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back Use oftenComey throws AG Lynch “under the bus” Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 more?Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job SlimeballSo proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had There won’t be anything, or anyone, even closeA perfectly executed strike last night Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military Could not have had a better result Mission AccomplishedDOJ just issued the McCabe report -

making a fortune on NAFTAThey have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic With all of the money they make from the US, hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration lawsDACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon No longer works Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crimeCongress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job Act now Congress, our country is being stolenMexico has the absolute power not to let these large “Caravans” of people enter their country They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border lawsThese big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA They want in on the actMexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the US They laugh at our dumb immigration laws They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow,

Post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so REGISTER If the PO “increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $26 Billion” This Post Office scam must stop Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) nowWhile we are on the subject, it is reported that the US Post Office will lose $150 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon That amounts to Billions of Dollars The Failing NY Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and thatWashington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall

and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all costFor years and through many administrations, everyone

was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the DemsMany lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia casedon’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on Fame fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted Problem is that a newMuch can be done with the $16 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall It is just a down payment Work will start immediately The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)Because of the $700 $716

will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine gunsNews conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill 1:00 PMI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully fundedDACA was abandoned by the Democrats Very unfair to them Would have been tied to desperately needed WallHouse Intelligence Committee votes to release final report FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign Russia (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contactsI

always remain my friend There will be an official contact handover on 4/9My honor Charlie - thank you #MAGA As a candidate, I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade, protect American workers, and defend our national security Today, we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff Well, not saying that anymoreCrazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way Don’t threaten people JoeDemocrats refused to take care of DACA Would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care I had to fight for Military and start of WallGot $16 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next yearmost ever Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipmentThey can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race Bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts” Obama and Clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET) PEACE THROUGH STRENGTHI called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also) The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him They are wrong Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing“Special Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I am still opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed becausethere was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice” So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan DershowitzDepartment of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona I agree with @LouDobbs Should have sought reviewAUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD Great job by law enforcement and all concernedOur Nation was founded by farmers Our independence was won by farmers And our continent was tamed by farmers Our farmers always lead the way -- we are PROUD of them, and we are DELIVERING for them #NationalAgricultureDayThe Democrats do not want to help DACA Would be so easy to make a dealA total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest@seanhannity on @foxandfriends now Great 8:18 AMWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently addeddoes anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSIONSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date Same with lying James Comey Can we call them Fake Memos?Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked “have you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous source?” He said strongly “never, no” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriendsThe Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign WITCH HUNTThe Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much moreAs the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign As many are now finding out, however, there was

hundred thousand people in a single day at Yankee Stadium, to more than two million people at Madison Square Garden over sixteen weeks in 1957 Today, in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham – an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God’s grace Why is AG Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc Isn’t the IG an Obama guy?

Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff SessionsThe GREAT Billy Graham is dead There was nobody like him He will be missed by Christians and all religions A very special man@CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background ChecksSo true, thank you Bad ratings @CNN @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wiseMain Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law cameras running Another False Accusation Why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off Only @FoxNews so reporteddoesn’t fit the Mainstream Media narrativeA woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago Never happened Who would do this in a public space with live securityI have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts Total Fake NewsHope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary Your Original was correct Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes waste moneyMatt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House You’ve come a long way MattRepublicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R’s want to fixThe President Obama quote just before election That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat” When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems“There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections, there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I’d invite Mr Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes” Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more We are now starting to win again“The Faith of Donald Trump,” a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb, is a very interesting read EnjoyThe US economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations Taxes have been massively Cut JOBS, JOBS, JOBS@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsementObama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling?Have a great, but very reflective, President’s DayJust watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the othersMy great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today, The Daytona 500 Brian France and the France family are special people Enjoy the raceThank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc Really great interview with @MariaBartiromoGreat Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot Big gain over last 4 weeks I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans, the Cuts the Dems want to take away We need more RepublicansThe Fake News of big ratings loser CNN If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the US then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams They are laughing their asses off in Moscow Get smart AmericaNow that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election But wasn’t I a great candidate?I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never didFinally, Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election He is finally right about something Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing Thank you AdamNever gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $17 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigationGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta CompanyVery sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter This is not acceptable They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion Get back to the basics and make us all proudJust like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House Senate during the Obama Administration Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk“I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal” Rob Goldman Vice President of Facebook Ads The Fake News Media never fails Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t knowDeputy AG Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election“Charges Deal Don A Big Win,” written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that “the Russians had no impact on the election results” There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign “She lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate Case closed”Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County, Florida Will never forget them, or the eveningOur entire Nation, one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims their families in Parkland, FL To teachers, law enforcement, first responders medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President The results of the election were not impacted The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusionCannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democratstotally abandoned Republicans are still working hardI will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered Am also working with Congress on many frontsPresidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland, Florida: lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement, and a vote FOR open borders If Dems are actually serious about DACA, they should support the Grassley billThe Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe @DHSgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in America” It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn’t build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visaIn times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USASo many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem Must always report such instances to authorities, again and againJust spoke to Governor Rick Scott We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shootingMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American schoolToday, I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate, as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America’s depleted infrastructure As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all Proclamation: Negotiations on DACA have begun Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity March 5thOur infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more Bipartisan, make deal Dems?The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year See you at

far ahead of scheduleSo many positive things going on for the USA and the Fake News Media just doesn’t want to go there Same negative stories over and over again No wonder the People no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history #MAGAMy Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @WestervillePD Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA They only want to use it as a campaign issue Vote Republicanagencies, not just the FBI DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don’t believe were accuratehe leaked information (corrupt)” Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews“My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the ClintoDNC Dossier, it shows that he’s been victimized He’s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts ofPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation Some are true and some are false Some are old and some are new There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?According to the @nytimes, a Russian sold phony secrets on “Trump” to the US Asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time I hope people are now seeing understanding what is going on here It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMPThe Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency Told them to re-do and send back in proper formJobless claims have dropped to a 45 year lowCosts on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start nowWithout more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage Must elect more Republicans in 2018 ElectionJust signed Bill Our Military will now be stronger than ever before We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more First time this has happened in a long time Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBSWow -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch Warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame All tied into Crooked HillaryTime to end the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans As long as we open our eyes to God’s grace - and open our hearts to God’s love - then America will forever be the land of the free, the home of the brave, and a light unto all nations

leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13, and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it Watch here: We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration cancels the visa lottery If D’s oppose this deal, they aren’t serious about DACA-they just want open borders My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken @ColtsSo disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson This is just one of many such preventable tragedies We

in the world If there is no Wall, there is no DealWill be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE, running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13) Rick is a great guy We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agendaThe Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the US The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the US NAFTA is a bad jokeThe Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved

rivers or waterISIS is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more Together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media We ARE Making America Great AgainDespite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud ofAnd

Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to the @WhiteHouse “President Donald J Trump Proclaims January 16, 2018, as Religious Freedom Day” Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled Thank you, and it will get even (much) better @FoxNews“90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived@foxandfriendsDo you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the Dems Public gets itThe Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now No more dangerous LotteryWe must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our countrySenator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting Deals can’t get made when there is no trust Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Militaryto stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do” My standard is very simple, AMERICA FIRST MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAINStatement by me last night in Florida: “Honestly, I don’t think the Democrats want to make a deal They talk about DACA, but they don’t want to helpWe are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to They don’t want security at the border, they don’t wantbig unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible” (among many other things) “President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama, and reversed our economic decline” Thank you Stuart Varney @foxandfriends“President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy Tax Cut

President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT No more Lotteries #AMERICA FIRSTDACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Militaryand they knew exactly what I said and meant They just wanted a story FAKE NEWSThe Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N Korea) Obviously I didn’t say that I said “I’d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,” a big difference Fortunately we now record conversations with reportersSo much Fake News is being reported They don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the electionI don’t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA They are all talk and no action This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have Too badAMERICA FIRSTThe Democrats are all talk and no action They are doing nothing to fix DACA Great opportunity missed Too badYesterday was a big day for the stock market Jobs are coming back to America Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing American business is hot againToday, it was my great honor to proclaim January 15, 2018, as Martin Luther King Jr, Federal Holiday I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of Dr King's life and legacy Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country Never said “take them out” Made up by Dems I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trustSadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRSTThe language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACABecause of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards The Dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAINcountries which are doing badly I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level I want safety and security for our people I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defundThe so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards Wall was not properly funded, Chain Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crimeReason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 12 billion dollars Bad deal Wanted me to cut ribbon-NOThe Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery Chain USADemocrat Dianne Feinstein should never

drug addiction and overdose in the United States Great news, as a result of our TAX CUTS JOBS ACT With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land We need it Get smart“45 year low in illegal immigration this year” @foxandfriends“House votes on controversial FISA ACT today” This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?In new Quinnipiac Poll, 66% of people feel the economy is “Excellent or Good” That is the highest number ever recorded by this pollDisproven and paid for by Democrats “Dossier used to spy on Trump

Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante A must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in US political history EnjoyWith the great vote on Cutting Taxes, this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOUPutting PelosSchumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and bordersso much more Look at your 401-k’s since Election Highest Stock Market EVER Jobs are roaring backDemocrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, VA, Judges 2nd Amendment and more No to Jones, a PelosSchumer PuppetReport: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE” Now it all starts to make sensePeople who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of @ABC News (he has been suspended), should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollarsAfter years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History But fear not, we will bring it back to greatnessTainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI “agent’s role in Clinton probe under review” Led Clinton Email probe @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in chargeSuch a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn Just more Fake News covering another Comey lieCongratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake NewsMany people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails? No justiceSo General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many timesand nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?Great job First Lady Melania 62 years ago this week, a brave seamstress in Montgomery, Alabama uttered one word that changed history I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI He has pled guilty to those lies It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful There was nothing to hideBiggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitmentWe are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America Special thanks to @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas Economists on the TAX CUTS and JOBS ACT: “The enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will IGNITE our ECONOMY with levels of GROWTH not SEEN IN GENERATIONS” The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country The Bill is getting better and better This is a once in a generation chance Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the creditThe jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon The SchumePelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 ElectionsThe Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice BUILD THE WALLA disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal ImmigrationThe Christmas Story begins 2,000 years ago with a mother, a father, their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all—the gift of God’s love for all of humanity Whatever our beliefs, we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of his life Today is a day that I’ve been looking very

The Dow just broke 24,000 for the first time (another all-time Record) If the Dems had won the Presidential Election, the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence, which is also at an all-time high, would be “low and glum”Stock Market hits new Record High Confidence and enthusiasm abound More great numbers coming outThe Chinese Envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man Hard to believe his people, and the military, put up with living in such horrible conditions Russia and China condemned the launchThe Failing @nytimes has totally gone against the Social Media Guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went Rogue @foxandfriendsThe Failing @nytimes, the pipe organ for the Democrat Party, has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winnerFunny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years“Had the information (Crooked Hillary’s emails) been released there would have been harm to National SecurityThe only people who don’t like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don’t understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the RepublicansThe House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump Big stuff Deep State Give this information NOW @FoxNews@Theresa_May, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom We are
