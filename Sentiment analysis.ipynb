decimated by dumb politicians drew less than with Bill VP CrookedHillary Obamas third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth seen below Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better Why doesnt the media want to report that on the two Big Thursdays when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches Republicans won ratings CrookedHillary Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes A formula for disaster Violent crime is rising across the United States yet the DNC convention ignored it Crime reduction will be one

only getting worse People want LAW AND ORDER Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me and forgot to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke CNN and the little watched Morning Joe SAD No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes Hillarys wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction terrorism and ISIS across the world Hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety Hillary will never reform Wall Street She is owned by Wall Street Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words Hillarys

flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining then a small one PatheticOur not very bright Vice President Joe Biden just stated that I wanted to carpet bomb the enemy Sorry Joe that was Ted Cruz Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about The danger is massive NO Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally Get tough The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country No recognition SAD Funny how the failing nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said Trump is a genius America st As I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election despite her statements to the contrary top adv Just like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP Many of Bernies supporters have left the arena Did Bernie go home and go to sleep I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the Democratic Convention No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible Highly overrated You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is and neither does ISIS a good thing Please get your facts straight thanks megynkellyFor the record I have ZERO investments in Russia In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump Crazy  CrookedHillary Dems dont want to talk ISIS b c Hillarys foreign interventions unleashed ISIS her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here Bernies exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar Thank you New Hampshire MakeAmericaGreatAgain Join us in Toledo Ohio tomorrow night at pm TrumpPence MAGA Tickets Join us tomorrow in Scranton Pennsylvania at pm TrumpPence MAGA Tickets Pocahontas bombed last night Sad to watch Why arent the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order The Republican Convention was greatFunny if you listen to FoxNews the Democrats did not have a good day If you listen to the other two they are fawning What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it Waste of time Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future I know more about Cory than he knows about himself I was at FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing He asked if he could have pictures taken with me I said fine He then trashes on air Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money The V P a joke While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers Clinton betrayed Bernie voters Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War Thank you OHIO TrumpPence Thank you Roanoke Virginia be back soon TrumpPence MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN TrumpPence  MakeAmericaGreatAgain Great POLL numbers are coming out all over People dont want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse MAGAThe State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e mails yet can you believe Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC they just got caught thats all They laughed at Bernie If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same Thank you MakeAmericaGreatAgain Hillary was involved in the e mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e mails using even religion against Bernie The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e mails which should never have been written stupid because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on Minutes No way they are going to fix Americas problems ISIS all others laughing The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great Thank you The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory shes out The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing E mails say the rigged system is alive well Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I dont believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player Bernie media would go wildThe CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher Dont watch CNN I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left Today proves what I have always known that Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz DWStweets Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just cant go on any longer He is trying to dismiss the new e mails and DNC disrespect SAD There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure wants it all to end An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates Looks like the Bernie people will fight If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time Kaine stands for opposite Wow President Obamas brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me Was probably treated badly by president like everybody else Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V P is ending really weak So much for a movement TOTAL DISRESPECTThe Crooked Hillary V P choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H  MakeAmericaGreatAgain TrumpPence  NancyNielsenn realDonaldTrump Dinesh DSousa Hillarys America see it  OliMauritania realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night From the heart The Wikileaks e mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together ISIS and our other enemies are drooling They dont look presidential to me I will bring jobs back and get wages up People havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years Clinton killed jobs Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved Job killer Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs I will bring jobs back Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania Against steelworkers and miners Husband signed NAFTA Leaked e mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders Mock his heritage and much more On line from Wikileakes really vicious RIGGEDPocahontas wanted V P slot so badly but wasnt chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate Also Crooked Hillary hates her Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice Bernie fought for nothing The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for Philly fight  Theresa Cali realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS MakeAmericaSafeAgain I highly recommend the just out book THE FIELD OF FIGHT by General Michael Flynn How to defeat radical Islam Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didnt get indicted while Bob M did

mistakes now many bankruptcies Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country She is sooooo guilty But watch her time will come The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information Not fit Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U S Her temperament is weak and her opponents are

MakeAmericaGreatAgain Trump A great evening in Iowa Thank you Des Moines Area Community College for a great forum Trump IAForums John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed

fell right into President Obama s trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it Shame Doesn t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else he s almost last John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me but his proposal was a rip off I said NO Now ripping Kasich I loved beating John Kasich in the debates but it was easyhe came in dead last Kasich has already spent million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down People from NH are smart Watch Kasich squirm if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don t want to waste my money John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls Pathetic John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me Governor Kasich whose failed campaign debating skills have brought him way down in the polls

McCain One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians I will fix VA quickly Via fitsnews Donald Trump John McCain Is A Loser Why would anybody listen to MittRomney He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama By the way so did John McCain Congrats to the new Gov of Texas GregAbbott TX for taking a tough bold stance at the border Should have been done long ago by Perry I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans Veterans deserve universal access to care VA scandal proves politicians are inept  that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care Its a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans I will make this right for our great Vets All he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything  John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years Captured or not all our soldiers are heroes In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa got a standing ovation

of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare Wrong I know the subject well want victory for U S The failing nytimes writes false story after false story about me They don t even call to verify the facts of a story A Fake News Joke I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare They really want to get it right unlike OCare With ZERO Democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy the Republican Senators are working hard So they caught Fake News CNN cold but what about NBC CBS ABC What about the failing nytimes washingtonpost They are all Fake News Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories Ratings way down Wow CNN had to retract big story on Russia with employees forced to resign What about all the other phony stories they do FAKE NEWS Great day for America s future Security and Safety courtesy of the U S Supreme Court I will keep fighting for the American people WIN From FoxNews Bombshell In Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election Check out his statement Witch Hunt Very grateful for the O decision from the U S Supreme Court We must keep America SAFE Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats Not easy Perhaps just let OCare crash burn  under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of T people colluding There is no collusion no obstruction I should be given apology The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling With months looking at Russia  and did not want to rock the boat He didn t choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas All they do is delay and complain They own ObamaCare Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders Is she allowed to so collude Unfair to Bernie MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer Obama Administration official said they choked when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election They didn t want to hurt Hillary Since the Obama Administration was told way before the Election that the Russians were meddling why no action Focus on them not T Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums deductibles increase by over Remember keep your doctor keep your plan Just out The Obama

term that won t help us protect our people Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his no reason to be alarmed statement MSM is working hard to sell it  foxandfriends Dems are taking forever to approve my people including Ambassadors They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS Want approvals In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U S in order to help keep our country safe The courts are slow and political The Justice Dept should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court seek much tougher version The Justice Dept should have stayed with the original Travel Ban not the watered down politically correct version they submitted to S C People the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want but I am calling it what we need and what it is a TRAVEL BAN Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now That s because they used knives and a truck At least dead and wounded in terror attack and

by say hel China just agreed that the U S will be allowed to sell beef and other major products into China once again This is REAL news When James Clapper himself and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt says there is no collusion when does it end James Comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press  Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future press briefings and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy As a very active President with lots of things happening it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy The Fake Media is working overtime today Again the story that there was collusion between the Russians Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election Yesterday on the same day I had meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the FM of Ukraine Pavlo Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U S tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election We finally agree on something Rosie  Presidential Executive Order on the Establishment of Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity  Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure The Democrats should be ashamed This is a disgrace DrainTheSwamp Dems have been complaining for months months about Dir Comey Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved Phony hypocrites The Roger Stone report on CNN is false Fake News Have not spoken to Roger in a long time had nothing to do with my decision caught he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness and now he is judge jury He should be the one who is investigated for his acts years as a pol in Connecticut Blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in Vietnam except he was never there When Watching Senator Richard Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke Richie devised one of the greatest military frauds in U S history For Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington Republican and Democrat alike When things calm down they will be thanking me James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey including the fact that he should be fired but now they play so sad Cryin Chuck Schumer stated recently I do not have confidence in him James Comey any longer Then acts so indignant draintheswamp Manufacturing openings hires rise to highest levels of the recovery It was an honor to welcome the Teachers of the Year to the WH last month Today we honor and thank all teachers Biggest story today between Clapper Yates is on surveillance Why doesn t the media report on this FakeNews The Russia Trump collusion story is a total hoax when will this taxpayer funded charade end Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today she said nothing but old news Director Clapper reiterated what everybody including the fake media already knows there is no evidence of collusion w Russia and Trump Honored to welcome Georgia Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili to the WhiteHouse today with VP Mike Pence Ask Sally Yates under oath if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she

that s sold in U S Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France I look very much forward to working with him Republican Senators will not let the American people down ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up it was a lie and it is dead When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia why the DNC wouldn t allow the FBI to check their server or investigate The reason I am staying in Bedminster N J a beautiful community is that staying in NYC is much more expensive and disruptive Meetings What s more important Rebuilding our military or bailing out insurance companies Ask the Democrats I promise to rebuild our military and secure our border Democrats want to shut down the government Politics I want to help our miners while the Democrats are blocking their healthcare The Democrats want to shut government if we don t bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure NO  subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all we will then terminate NAFTA Relationships are good deal very possible I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate I agreed Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous ObamaCare and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars Sad A great great

no safety Hillary will never reform Wall Street She is owned by Wall Street Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words Hillary s

adv Just like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP Many of Bernie s supporters have left the arena Did Bernie go home and go to sleep I hate to say it

fawning What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it Waste of time Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future I know more about Cory than he knows about himself I was at FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing He asked if he could have pictures taken with me I said fine He then trashes on air Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold He got NOTHING for all of the time energy

spinnnn Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e mails yet can you believe Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing E mails say the rigged system is alive well Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don t believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player Bernie media would go wildThe CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher Don t watch CNN I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left Today proves what I have always known that Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz DWStweets Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can t go on any longer He is trying to dismiss the new e mails and DNC disrespect SAD There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure wants it all to end An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates Looks like the Bernie people will fight If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time Kaine stands for opposite Wow President Obama s brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me Was probably treated badly by president like everybody else Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the

book too seriously Katelyn Caralle Washington ExaminerThe White House is a smooth running machine We are making some of the biggest and most important deals in our country s history with many more to come The Dems are going crazy The Woodward book is a Joke just another assault against me in a barrage of assaults using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them like the book are fiction Dems can t stand losing I ll write the real book If the Democrats had won the Election in GDP which was about and going down would have been minus

than any other Administration in the history of our Country I m tough as hell on people if I weren t nothing would get done Also I question everybody everything which is why I got elected Isn t it a shame that someone can write an article or book totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact and get away with it without retribution or cost Don t know why Washington politicians don t change libel laws  Secretary Mattis Nukes Woodward Allegations Jim Mattis Calls Woodward Book Fiction Product of Someone s Rich Imagination The already discredited Woodward book so many lies and phony sources has me calling Jeff Sessions mentally retarded and a dumb southerner I said NEITHER never used those terms on anyone including Jeff and being a southerner is a GREAT thing He made this up to divide Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake NBC News said it s time for the Press to stop complaining and to start fighting back Actually Chuck they ve been

officials and follow NHC Atlantic for updates The Federal Government stands ready to assist Be safe NBC FAKE NEWS which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the Harvey Weinstein story is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards worse than even CNN Look at their license President Bashar al Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed Don t let that happen According to the Failing New York Times the FBI started a major effort to flip Putin loyalists in It wasn t about Trump he wasn t even close to a candidate yet Rigged Witch Hunt I see that John Kerry the father of the now terminated Iran deal is thinking of running for President I should only be so lucky although the field that is currently assembling looks really good FOR ME  The Democrats none of whom voted for Jeff Sessions must love him now Same thing with Lyin James Comey The Dems all hated him wanted him out thought he was disgusting UNTIL I FIRED HIM Immediately he became a wonderful man a saint like figure in fact Really sick Two long running Obama era investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge just ahead of the Mid Terms by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time Good job Jeff The U S is respected again Richard Trumka the head of the AFL CIO represented his union poorly on television this weekend Some of the things he said were so against the working men and women of our country and the success of the U S itself that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly A Dem The Worker in America is doing better than ever before Celebrate Labor Day Happy Labor Day Our country is doing better than ever before with unemployment setting record lows The U S has tremendous upside potential as we go about fixing some of the worst Trade Deals ever made by any country in the world Big progress being made  The fact is that African American unemployment is now the lowest in the history of our country Same with Asian Hispanic and almost every other group The Democrats have been all talk and no action My Administration has already produced like no other and everyone sees it Tiger Woods showed great class in the way he answered the question about the Office of the Presidency and me Now they say the so called left is angry at him So sad but the center right loves Tiger Kanye George Foreman Jim Brown so many other greats even more  There is no possible way the Trump Tower meeting between Don Trump jr and a couple of Russians who have very deep connections to both the Clintons Fusion GPS where no information on the Clintons was exchanged is a crime Dems are blinded by their hatred of Trump Bongino No information was ever given by the Trump Team to Russia yet the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for information from Kremlin sources and just washed it through an intermediary Christopher Steele Jesse Waters positions of power That s part of the story of the Russia Hoax Christopher Steele is on the payroll of Hillary Clinton the FBI when they fired him for lying they continued to use him Violation of FBI regulations Kept trying to verify the unverifiable GreggJarrett There s no fairness here if you re a Democrat or a friend of Hillary you get immunity or off scott free If you re connected to Donald Trump you get people like Robert Mueller Andrew Weissman and his team of partisans coming after you with a vengeance and abusing their We shouldn t have to buy our friends with bad Trade Deals and Free Military Protection MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN No Deal Trade Talks with Canada Conclude for the Week with No Agreement Breitbart  Remember NAFTA was one of the WORST Trade Deals ever made The U S lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs We were far better off before NAFTA should never have been signed Even the Vat Tax was not accounted for We make new deal or go back to pre NAFTA There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal If we don t make a fair deal for the U S after decades of abuse Canada will be out Congress should not interfere w these negotiations or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely we will be far better off  Donald Trump and now we find out that there wasn t even a hearing that Donald Trump s th Amendment right to privacy was signed away and someone in there is swearing that this stuff is true when it wasn t This is the scandal here a police state Dan Bongino You have a Fake Dossier gathered by Steele paid by the Clinton team to get information on Trump The Dossier is Fake nothing in it has been verified It then filters into our American court system in order to spy on Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton s political opponent  of the DOJ FBI are completely out to lunch in terms of exposing and holding those accountable who are responsible for that corruption TomFitton JudicialWatchReport There were no FISA hearings held over Spy documents It is astonishing that the FISA courts couldn t hold hearings on Spy Warrants targeting Donald Trump It isn t about Carter Page it s about the Trump Campaign You ve got corruption at the DOJ FBI The leadership I love Canada but they ve taken advantage of our Country for many years  I think today what has happened is that news reporting has become part of the adversary system Alan Dershowitz It has become tainted and corrupt DJTStill can t believe that Bloomberg violated a firm OFF THE RECORD statement Will they put out an apology Great day in North Carolina where Republicans will do very well The ABC Washington Post Poll was by far the least accurate one weeks out from the Election I call it a suppression poll but by Election Day they brought us out of shame to about even They will never learn  Rasmussen Poll just came out at approval rate despite the constant and intense Fake News Higher than Election Day and higher than President Obama Rasmussen was one of the most accurate Election Day polls  President Donald J Trump is Strengthening Retirement Security for American Workers Wow I made OFF THE RECORD COMMENTS to Bloomberg concerning Canada and this powerful understanding was BLATANTLY VIOLATED Oh well just more dishonest reporting I am used to it At least Canada knows where I stand I will be doing a major rally for Senator Ted

place of Don McGahn as White House Counsel I liked Don but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions So much Fake Reporting and Fake News The Rigged Russia Witch Hunt did not come into play even a little bit with respect to my decision on Don McGahn Wow Nellie Ohr Bruce Ohr s wife is a Russia expert who is fluent in Russian She worked for Fusion GPS where she was paid a lot Collusion Bruce was a boss at the Department of Justice and is unbelievably still there The only thing James Comey ever got right was when he said that President Trump was not under investigation Ivanka Trump Jared Kushner had NOTHING to do with the so called pushing out of Don McGahn The Fake News Media has it purposely so wrong They love to portray chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn t exist just a smooth running machine with changing parts The news from the Financial Markets is even better than anticipated For all of you that have made a fortune in the markets or seen your k s rise beyond your wildest expectations more good news is coming I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is Truth doesn t matter to them they only have their hatred agenda This includes fake books which come out about me all the time always anonymous sources and are pure fiction Enemy of the People What s going on at CNN is happening to different degrees at other networks with NBCNews being the worst The good news is that Andy Lack y is about to be fired for incompetence and much worse When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia they were hurt badly The hatred and extreme bias of me by CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function But actually as I have always said this has been going on for a long

to spy on the Trump campaign This is a fraud on the court The Chief Justice of the U S Supreme Court is in  Lanny Davis admits being anonymous source in CNN Report BretBaier Oh well so much for CNN saying it wasn t Lanny No wonder their ratings are so low it s FAKE NEWS CNN is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake Sloppy carlbernstein a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool making up story after story is being laughed at all over the country Fake News differences they will be resolved in time by President Trump and China s great President Xi Jinping Their relationship and bond remain very strong  of money on joint U S South Korea war games Besides the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea and Japan if he so chooses If he does they will be far bigger than ever before As for the U S China trade disputes and other  considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and various other commodities This is not helpful Nonetheless the President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong Un is a very good and warm one and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts STATEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE President Donald J Trump feels strongly that North Korea is under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese Government At the same time we also know that China is providing North Korea with  StopTheBias How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department Disgraceful Witch Hunt

Depression WashTimesFantastic numbers on consumer spending released on Friday Stock Market hits all time high  And it will get as I have always said much better from even here My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain Our hearts and prayers are with you Stock Market hit all time high on Friday Congratulations U S A Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour Some really good people within both the new and old government and all working closely together A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon  The FBI looked at less than of Crooked s Emails  The FBI only looked at of Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails They purposely didn t look at the disasters This news is just out FoxNewsBig story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails many of which are REALLY BAD Also gave false election info I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption At some point I may have to get involved  LindseyGrahamSC Every President deserves an Attorney General they have confidence in I believe every President has a right to their Cabinet these are not lifetime appointments You serve at the pleasure of the President Jeff Sessions said he wouldn t allow politics to influence him only because he doesn t understand what is happening underneath his command position Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched No Collusion Michaels Cohen s attorney clarified the record saying his client does not know if President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting out of which came nothing The answer is that I did NOT know about the meeting Just another phony story by the Fake News Media Happy birthday Vince

likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim I look forward to seeing him soon  Additionally because of our much tougher Trading stance with China I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were despite the UN Sanctions which are in place I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea at this time because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people Can t do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN whose ratings have suffered gravely People have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship Ex NSA contractor to spend months in jail over classified information Gee this is small potatoes compared to what Hillary Clinton did So unfair Jeff Double Standard  FISA

wonderful family Justice took a year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to break make up stories in order to get a deal Such respect

have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the Border into the United States ILLEGALLY If there were no serious consequences our country would be overrun with people trying to get in and our system could not handle it Fake News of which there is soooo much this time the very tired New Yorker falsely reported that I was going to take the extraordinary step of denying Intelligence Briefings to President Obama Never discussed or thought of Even James Clapper has admonished John Brennan for having gone totally off the rails Maybe Clapper is being nice to me so he doesn t lose his Security Clearance for lying to Congress A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders A Red Wave means Safety and Strength I am hearing so many great things about the Republican Party s California Gubernatorial Candidate John Cox He is a very successful businessman who is tired of high Taxes Crime He will Make California Great Again make you proud of your Great State again Total Endorsement Will be going to the Great State of West Virginia on Tuesday Night to campaign do a Rally Speech for a hard working and spectacular person A G Patrick Morrisey who is running for the

PARISDENNARD over Brennan s Security Clearance Dennard destroyed him but Mudd is in no mental condition to have such a Clearance Should be REVOKED seanhannity DianeHarkey is an extraordinary woman of great accomplishment potential She is running as a very popular Republican for the Congressional seat of my friend Darrell Issa with his complete support Diane is strong on crime loves our Military Vets has my total Endorsement It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U S Postal System from China We can and must END THIS NOW The Senate should pass the STOP ACT and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country No more delay  Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multi million dollar investigation into what apparently didn t happen Darrell Issa House Oversight We can take out the word apparently FoxNewsWill Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions Justice Department A total joke Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance it s worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan It certainly isn t because of the good job he did He is a political hack I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our country s history brings a lawsuit It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt He won t sue Where s the Collusion They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction of a phony crime that never existed If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction  looking for trouble They are enjoying ruining people s lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side the lies the firings the deleted Emails and soooo much more Mueller s Angry Dems are looking to impact the election They are a National Disgrace Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over hours with the White House Councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone Study the late Joseph McCarthy because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby Rigged Witch Hunt Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times They actually called to complain and apologize a big step forward From the day I announced the Times has been Fake News and with their disgusting new Board Member it will only get worse The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President when in fact it is just the opposite the two Fake reporters knew this This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People So bad for America No Collusion and No Obstruction except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats All of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction What about the Brennan Comey McCabe Strzok lies to Congress or Crooked s Emails  and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close So many lives have been ruined over nothing McCarthyism at its WORST Yet Mueller his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side Media is even worse The failing nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel he must be a John Dean type RAT But I allowed him and all others to testify I didn t have to I have nothing to hide I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents Most transparent in history No Collusion No Obstruction Witch Hunt The United States has ended the ridiculous Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the U S I want to develop the U S our military and countries that help us The Economy is stronger and better than ever before Importantly there remains tremendous potential it will only get better with time Great Job Rachel Campos Duffy on foxandfriends Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director He will go down as easily the WORST in history since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction China But in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone  Too many voices are being destroyed some good some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen Who is making the choices because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made Let everybody participate good bad and we will all just have to figure it out  Censorship is a very dangerous thing absolutely impossible to police If you are weeding out Fake News there is nothing so Fake as CNN MSNBC yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or don t watch at all Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican Conservative voices Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration we won t let that happen They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT while at the same time doing nothing to others  financial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation Bribery Statute Violation Honest Services Violation all Major Crimes because the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions Gregg Jarrett So when does Mueller do what must be done Probably never FoxNews Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy it s astonishing that he s still employed Bruce Nelly Ohr s bank account is getting fatter fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling He doesn t disclose it under Fed Regs Using your Federal office for personal  Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti Trump Russia probe will be exposed Charles Payne FoxBusiness How much more does Mueller have to see They have blinders on RIGGED  I say Andrew s was a bigger and more incompetent blunder He should easily win his race against a Super Liberal Actress but his political career is over Which is worse Hightax Andrew Cuomo s statement WE RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT or Hillary Clinton s DEPLORABLES statement When a politician admits that We re not going to make America great again there doesn t seem to be much reason to ever vote for him This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo with many wanting him to resign he will get higher ratings than his brother Chris Wow Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America s lack of greatness I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military setting records and we will do even better Andrew choked badly mistake The U S has more than double the growth rate than it had months ago Just announced youth unemployment is at a year low foxandfriends attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date go to the Paris parade celebrating the end of the War on November th Maybe we will do something next year in D C when the cost comes WAY DOWN Now we can buy some more jet fighters The local politicians who run Washington D C poorly know a windfall when they see it When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it Never let someone hold you up I will instead How does a politician Cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the U S survive making the statement WE RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT Which section of the sentence is worse In speaking with some of the world s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business jobs even better in the U S Stop quarterly reporting go to a six month system said one That would allow greater flexibility save money I have asked the SEC to study  released in If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office it constitutes an intelligence breach Richard Burr R NC Senate Intel Cmte Chair LouDobbs Director Brennan s recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power If Director Brennan s statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA why didn t he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment  An incredibly corrupt FBI DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election Brennan has gone off the deep end he s disgraced and discredited himself His conduct has been outrageous Chris Farrell Judicial Watch How can Senator Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam pass judgement on anyone Loser  TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place Now that is a really good question Then followed by Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero So true a total Fake  Very concerned about Comey s firing afraid they will be exposed said Bruce Ohr DOJ s Emails Notes show Bruce Ohr s connection to phony discredited Trump Dossier A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act Rigged Witch Hunt  While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch Catherine Herridge of FoxNews LouDobbs In other words they were colluding with Russia  The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr of the Justice Department whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok This is too crazy to be believed The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man but we are cutting back on Turkey Thank you for the kind words Omarosa Great Cabinet meeting today at the WhiteHouse The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin is dead She was a great woman with a wonderful gift from God her voice She will be missed There is nothing that I would want more for

the Iranians are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency  WE RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the U S Andrew Cuomo having a total meltdown  Hillary Clinton clearly got a pass by the FBI We have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame Donald Trump concerning the Rigged Witch Hunt JOE DIGENOVA former U S Attorney  John Brennan is a stain on the Country

these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started There was no Collusion or Obstruction with

Trump for things he didn t do Gregg Jarrett on foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General this Witch Hunt would never have been started Looking at the wrong people Bruce Ohr of the Justice Department can you believe he is still there is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele find dirt on Trump Ohr s wife Nelly was in on the act big time worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier foxandfriendsAnother terrorist attack in London These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength When you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn t work out Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog  should be shut down The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors Thank you Judicial Watch I couldn t have said it better myself  guy was corrupt and had anti Trump animus Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation Instead Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong He used Strzok he used the Clinton DNC Dossier the whole thing Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI We know this  such wonderful and powerful things about me a true Champion of Civil Rights until she got fired Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media they didn t want interviews when she worked in the White House Now that she says bad about me they will talk to her Fake News  MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO

unpopular Governor of Ohio and failed presidential candidate JohnKasich hurt Troy Balderson s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate Even Kasich s Lt Governor lost Gov race because of his unpopularity Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN While I know it s not presidential to take on a lowlife like Omarosa and while I would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form

work When Gen Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser nothing but problems I told him to try working it out if possible because she only said GREAT things about me until she got fired Wacky

Looking forward to the new IG Report  Collusion with Russia was very real Hillary Clinton and her team colluded with the Russians and so did Adam Schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was Russians to obtain compromising material on DJT We also know that Hillary Clinton paid through Presidential Approval numbers are very good strong economy military and just about everything else Better numbers than Obama at this point by far We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave but there might be a Red Wave Too bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS  Why aren t Mueller and the Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country Fortunately the facts are all coming out and fast Fake News reporting a complete fabrication that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son Donald had in Trump Tower This was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics and it went nowhere I did not know about it  Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the Trillion in debt that has been accumulated much by the Obama Administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people At minimum we will make much better Trade Deals for our country Tariffs are working big time Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U S always to our detriment I say as they come Tax them If they don t want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the U S In either event it means jobs and great wealth The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it s TRUE I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People They purposely cause great division distrust They can also cause War They are very dangerous sick  Danny O Connor is a total puppet for Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters Danny wants to raise your taxes open your

other countries We are Winning but must be strong  Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today Only fools would disagree We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs We win either way  Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry Plants are opening all over the U S Steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury Other countries use Tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream Tariffs are working far

One or Paul Manafort political operative Reagan Dole darling now serving solitary confinement although convicted of nothing Where is the Russian Collusion Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign one of the most successful in history is a TOTAL HOAX The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was along with Comey McCabe Strzok and his lover the lovely Lisa Page used to begin the Witch Hunt Disgraceful Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders He worked for me for a very short time Why didn t government tell me that he was under investigation These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion a Hoax  This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further Bob Mueller is totally conflicted and his Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA  remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated This is a real issue It won t go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation ALAN DERSHOWITZ  FBI Agent Peter Strzok on the Mueller team should have recused himself on day one He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP He needed an insurance

Dems some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary others including himself have worked for Obama And why isn t Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side Podesta Dossier Is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump including the fact that we had a very nasty contentious business relationship I turned him down to head the FBI one day before appointment as S C Comey is his close friend There is No Collusion The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt headed now by increased from including an Obama White House lawyer Angry Democrats was started by a fraudulent Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC Therefore the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam  and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements and they will never change  dying newspaper industry No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people As an example the failing New York Times  accurately of media coverage of my Administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving it s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti Trump haters in the When the media driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome reveals internal deliberations of our government it truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk Very unpatriotic Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news I would be willing to shut down government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall Must get rid of Lottery Catch Release etc and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT We need great people coming into our Country The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by Billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for African Americans Hispanics Asians and Women Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A G Sulzberger Publisher of the New York Times Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media how that Fake News has

with dumb questions NO Arrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major U S Steel plant in Granite City Illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the

client So sad Is this a first never heard of it before Why was the tape so abruptly terminated cut while I was presumably saying positive things I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so Too bad China is targeting our farmers who they know I love respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U S They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt We were being nice until now China made Billion on us last year When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity Negotiations are going really well be cool The end result will be worth it Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off Lost Billion on Trade last year No weakness  The Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton Frame Donald Trump is a Hot Seller already Number One More importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune This would have been a great and

unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate This should have taken place many years ago but as the saying goes better late than never  MadeInAmerica Showcase Lou Barletta was one of my first supporters He is tough on Crime and Borders Will be a great Senator from Pennsylvania His opponent is WEAK on Crime ICE and Borders We need Lou Robert will do a great job for our Vets We also recently won Choice  In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for Amazon Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U S Supreme Court two months ago Next up is the U S Post Office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their delivery boy for a BIG percentage of their packages A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in months Likewise no Nuclear Tests Japan is happy all of Asia is happy But the Fake News is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that I am angry because it is not going fast enough Wrong very happy When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin and all that I gave up remember I gave up NOTHING we merely talked about future benefits for both countries Also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the Corrupt Media  Carter Page wasn t a spy wasn t an agent of the Russians he would have cooperated with the FBI It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump Tom Fitton JudicialWatch A disgrace to America They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now  and the DOJ FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account Source was the major source Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team Not about Carter Page was all about getting Trump  It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team This is a Clinton Campaign document It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC that was knowingly falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt Tom Fitton on foxandfriends at A M NOW Judicial Watch To Iranian President Rouhani NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE DEATH BE CAUTIOUS So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election Why didn t he do something about it Why didn t he tell our campaign Because it is all a big hoax that s why and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win Happy Birthday SenatorDole I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it So bad for our country  PeteHegseth on FoxNews Source was the Fake Dossier Yes the Dirty Dossier paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump and looking for information that could discredit Candidate Trump Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign ILLEGAL Andrew McCarthy I said this could never happen This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it It is so bad it screams out at you On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt Looking more more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC Ask her how that worked out she did better with Crazy Bernie Republicans must get tough now An illegal Scam Congratulations to JudicialWatch and TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of Justice and FBI misled the courts Witch Hunt Rigged a Scam Troy Balderson of Ohio is running for Congress against a Nancy Pelosi Liberal who is WEAK on Crime Borders Troy is the total opposite and loves our Military Vets nd Amendment EARLY VOTING just started with Election Day on August th Troy has my Full Total Endorsement Brian Kemp who is running for Governor of Georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with VP mike pence Brian is very strong on Crime and Borders LOVES our Military Vets and the nd Amendment He will be a GREAT Governor No Collusion No Obstruction but that doesn t matter because the Angry Democrats who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing The Rigged Witch Hunt headed by the Angry Democrats and now more have been added one who worked directly for Obama W H seems intent on damaging the Republican Party s chances in the November Election This Democrat excuse for losing the Election never ends Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer s office early in the morning almost unheard of Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of perhaps illegal The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again can t believe it Isn t it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart The Commissioner must now make a stand First time kneeling out for game Second time kneeling out for season no pay I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy If I was loud vicious I would have been criticized for being too tough Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim Hypocrites So important Should have been done years ago Farmers have been on a downward trend for years The price of soybeans has fallen since years before the Election A big reason is bad terrible Trade Deals with other countries They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers Canada charges on Dairy Farmers will WIN  The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well Tightening now hurts all that we have done The U S should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals Debt coming due we are raising rates Really China the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the U S is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge As usual not a level playing field My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri Such a tragedy such a great loss May God be with you all Will the Dems and Fake News ever learn This is classic  Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES  proliferation cyber attacks trade Ukraine Middle East peace North Korea and more There are many answers some easy and some hard to these problems but they can ALL be solved The Summit with Russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the Fake News Media I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for Israel nuclear I told you so The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies Google They truly have taken advantage of the U S but not for long Really big jobs meeting today at the White House P M  Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES Thank you to foxandfriends and FoxNews for actually showing the clips The Fake News wants no part of that narrative Too bad they don t want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia even a confrontation that could lead to war They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I ll probably have a good relationship with Putin We are doing MUCH better than any other country The Fake News Media is going Crazy They make up stories without any backup sources or proof Many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction Problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity But I ll complain anyway The Democrats have a death wish in more ways than one they actually want to abolish ICE This should cost them heavily in the Midterms Yesterday the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs Likewise to Pfizer We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U S Pastor Andrew Brunson from prison He has been held hostage far too long RT Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband father He has done nothing wrong and his family needs him The two biggest opponents of ICE in America today are the Democratic Party and MS Thank you to Congressman Kevin Yoder He secured BILLION for Border Security Now we need Congress to support Kevin

people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia They would rather go to war than see this It s called Trump Derangement Syndrome  A lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming we could have growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again foxandfriends kilmeadeCongratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress My endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve Enjoy  Russia has agreed to help with North Korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along There is no rush the sanctions remain Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with Russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success Many positive things will come out of that meeting So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match Big results will come  Prosperity is returning Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern American history Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs The Democrats want to abolish ICE which will mean more crime in our country I want to give ICE a big cheer Vote Republican in November The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success

s he supposed to think While I had a great meeting with NATO raising vast amounts of money I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia Sadly it is not being reported that way the Fake News is going Crazy I had a great meeting with NATO They have paid Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future only because of me NATO was weak but now it is strong again bad for Russia The media only says I was rude to leaders never mentions the money Will be interviewed on seanhannity tonight at pmE and TuckerCarlson tomorrow night at pmE Enjoy A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia but it is good for the world HELSINKI I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics HELSINKI As I said today and many times before I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people However I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past as the world s two largest nuclear powers we must get along HELSINKI Thank you Helsinki Finland Joint Press Conference from Helsinki Finland It was an honor to join you this morning Thank you Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U S foolishness and stupidity and now the Rigged Witch Hunt President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldn t happen was no big deal did NOTHING about it When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present future We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media NATO is now strong rich Congratulations to France who played extraordinary soccer on winning the World Cup Additionally congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament one of the best ever  know how to do is resist and obstruct This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country but at some point it will heal  over the years I would return to criticism that it wasn t good enough that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems Heading to Helsinki Finland looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow Unfortunately no matter how well I do at the Summit if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia There hasn t been a missile or rocket fired in months in North Korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages Who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isn t the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts Because it is FAKE NEWS These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years Why didn t Obama do something about it Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win that s why Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration but Fake News doesn t want to report the truth as usual Our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan We commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones  Remember it was Little Jeff Z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said I could not win the election in that there was no way to over over again in the Electoral College I got They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage Still hurting So funny I just checked out Fake News CNN for the first time in a long time they are dying in the ratings to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta actually a nice guy They didn t But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin Fake News The stories you heard about the Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administration Why didn t they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election  Where is the DNC Server and why didn t the FBI take possession of it Deep State The Stock Market hit yesterday Jobs are at an all time record and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government It is all happening I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf my primary form of exercise The weather is beautiful

the country they want protection from Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia Not acceptable All NATO Nations must meet their commitment and that must ultimately go to Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia They pay only a fraction of their cost The U S pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe and loses Big on Trade As I head out to a very important NATO meeting I see that FBI Lover Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena is refusing to show up and testify What can she possibly say about her statements and lies So much corruption on the other side Where is the Attorney General FoxNewsBillions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn t nearly enough U S spends too much Europe s borders are BAD Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former FBI Agent Lover Peter Strzok Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear Ex FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress Wow but is anybody really surprised Together with her lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER If the Democrats want to win Supreme Court and other Court picks don t Obstruct and Resist but rather do it the good ol fashioned way WIN ELECTIONS What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy Why are there only out of countries that have met their commitment The U S is paying for Europe s protection then loses billions on Trade Must pay of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now I am

the same Great news for the American people The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe U S has a Billion trade deficit and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO and nicely pay for it Just doesn t work A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans especially Hispanics feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama Many countries in NATO which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of which is low but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made Will they reimburse the U S Informing the Republican Senators of my nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh SCOTUS I am on Air Force One flying to NATO and

elsewhere We will respond The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out The U S strongly supports breast feeding but we don t believe women should be denied access to formula Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed even more importantly our handshake We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea China on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade Hope Not I have long heard that the most important decision a U S President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice Will be announced tonight at P M  Europe far more than it does the U S By some accounts the U S is paying for of NATO with many countries nowhere close to their commitment On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of Million with the U S with big Trade Barriers on U S goods NO The United States is spending far more

illegally deleted Emails the Pakistani Fraudster Uranium One Podesta so much more It s a Democrat Con Job Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the Special Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia so ridiculous that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation that the only Collusion was with the Dems Big decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon the Washington Post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don t exist They will both be out of business in years Just won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign and others colluded with Russia They haven t figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election JOBS JOBS JOBS Thanks to REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP America

gangs like MS We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL A vote for Democrats in November is a vote

your front lawn Hiring thousands of judges does not work and is not acceptable only Country in the World that does this Congress must pass smart fast and reasonable Immigration Laws now Law Enforcement at the Border is doing a great job but the laws they are forced to work with are insane When people with or without children enter our Country they must be told to leave without our Happy

attend the Greenbrier Classic Salute to Service Dinner in West Virginia God Bless our Veterans God Bless America and HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY TO ALL After having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake I capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b c they should be capitalized The Washington Post is constantly quoting anonymous sources that do not exist Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for They are a disgrace to journalism but then again so are many others Heading to West Virginia to be with my friend WVGovernor Jim Justice at his beautiful Greenbrier Resort He works hard does a great job and raises lots of money for charities Wow The NSA has deleted million phone calls and text messages Privacy violations They blame technical irregularities Such a disgrace The Witch Hunt continues Now that Harley Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U S my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U S Harley customers are not happy with their move sales are down in The U S is where the Action is Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation to Iranians including to government officials How big and bad is that Many good conversations with North Korea it is going well In the meantime no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in months All of Asia is thrilled Only the Opposition Party which includes the Fake News is complaining If not for me we would now be at War with North Korea How can the Democrats who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime do well in November The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning and not properly funding our great Law Enforcement When we have an infestation of MS GANGS in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out ICE They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country Dems do not appreciate the great job they do Nov The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and that s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country In any event they are coming along very well Most countries agree that they must be changed but nobody ever asked I interviewed very impressive people yesterday On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court Crazy Maxine Waters said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics is rapidly becoming together with Nancy Pelosi the FACE of the Democrat Party Her ranting and raving even referring to herself as a wounded animal will make people flee the Democrats Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their leadership wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE thereby declaring war on Law Order These people will be voting for Republicans in November and in many cases joining the Republican Party Today it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands to the WhiteHouse Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on

interviewed by MariaBartiromo at A M on FoxNewsWhen people come into our Country illegally we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime I will be interviewed by MariaBartiromo on Sunday on FoxNews at A M Enjoy Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous vote or Filibuster rule or better yet do both Cryin Chuck would do it on day one but we ll never give him the chance Some great legislation awaits be smart I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill either GOODLATTE or because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as

answer many questions There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt headed by Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted is Rigged  home addresses putting these selfless public servants in harm s way These radical protesters want ANARCHY but the only response they will find from our government is LAW AND ORDER In recent days we have heard shameless attacks on our courageous law enforcement

World War Two First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner Although he died years ago today he takes his rightful place in the Eternal Chronicle of American Valor SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN Wow  The most profound question of our era Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U S and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy Judge Andrew NapolitanoThe face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who together with Nancy Pelosi have established a fine leadership team They should always stay together and lead the Democrats who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime well into the future and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres A Harley Davidson should never be built in another country never Their employees and customers are already very angry at them If they move watch it will be the beginning of the end they surrendered they quit The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina Henry is tough on Crime and Borders loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN  We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E U in that they have long taken advantage of the U S in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs In the end it will all even out and it won t take very long  When I had Harley Davidson officials over to the White House I chided them about tariffs in other countries like India being too high Companies are now coming back to America Harley must know that they won t be able to sell back into U S without paying a big tax  We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint They must play fair or they will pay tariffs Early this year Harley Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand That was long before Tariffs were announced Hence they were just using Tariffs Trade War as an excuse Shows how unbalanced unfair trade is but we will fix it Thank you South Carolina Now let s get out tomorrow and VOTE for HenryMcMaster Just landed in South Carolina will be at the McMaster rally shortly MAGAThe hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI DOJ should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see We should expose these people for what they are there should be total transparency Why is Senator Mark Warner D VA perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller the leader of the Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt knows Isn t this highly illegal Is it being investigated  Director David Lynch Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents Surprised that Harley Davidson of all companies would be the first to wave the White Flag I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E U which has hurt us badly on trade down Billion Taxes just a Harley excuse be patient MAGACongresswoman Maxine Waters an extraordinarily low IQ person has become together with Nancy Pelosi the Face of the Democrat Party She has just called for harm to supporters of which there are many of the Make America Great Again movement Be careful what you wish for Max Will be heading to one of my favorite places South Carolina to fight for one of my original fighters Governor Henry McMaster Speaking at P M  If this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in it s tracks and at very little by comparison cost This is the only real answer and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL Hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go will always be disfunctional People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U S illegally Children brought back to their country Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama Fake News is working overtime I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI although I do not legally have to because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on But you do have to ask why the DOJ FBI aren t giving over requested documents The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows badly needs a paint job rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower Actually far greater than would ever have been believed  RepClayHiggins has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for Border Security our Military and are Vets He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement The Great State of Louisiana we want Clay House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember it still has to pass in the Senate and for that we need Democrat votes and all they do is RESIST They want Open Borders and don t care about Crime Need more Republicans to WIN in November  jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous hair show with me where he seriously messed up my hair that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have humanized me he is taking heat He called said monster ratings Be a man Jimmy The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country remove those Barriers Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U S A Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street  Our Immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years Immigration must be based on merit we need people who will help to Make America Great Again We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country When somebody comes in we must immediately with no Judges or Court Cases bring them back from where they came Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order Most children come without parents Democrats fix the laws Don t RESIST We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama but we need strength and security at the Border Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country Strong Borders No Crime Major Wall Street Journal opinion piece today talking

the investigators people want the investigators investigated Much more will come out A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election Steel is coming back fast U S Steel is adding great capacity also So are others Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U S its great companies and workers by the European Union if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed we will be placing a Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U S Build them here Our first duty and our highest loyalty is to the citizens of the United States We will not rest until our border is secure our citizens are safe and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all We are gathered today to hear directly from the AMERICAN VICTIMS of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION These are the American Citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens These are the families the media ignores Hope OPEC will increase output substantially Need to keep prices down We must maintain a Strong Southern Border We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections Obama and others had the same pictures and did nothing about it  of Mexico s Exports come to the United States They totally rely on us which is fine with me They do

we have the dumbest and the worst Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing Remember their motto RESIST Ours is PRODUCE Even if we get Republican votes in the Senate we need Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill the Dems are Obstructionists who won t give votes for political reasons because they don t care about Crime coming from Border So we need to elect more R s Our great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book Liars Leakers and Liberals the Case Against the Anti Trump Conspiracy which is fantastic Go get it You cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for

dream It won t happen Henry McMaster has done a great job as Governor of South Carolina The state is BOOMING with jobs and new industry setting records He is tough on Crime and Strong on Borders Healthcare the Military and our great Vets Henry has my full and complete Endrosement MAGAWhat is the purpose of the House doing good immigration bills when you need votes by Democrats in the Senate and the Dems are only looking to Obstruct which they feel is good for them in the Mid Terms Republicans must get rid of the stupid Filibuster Rule it is killing you Last night in Minnesota was incredible What a crowd I will be going the Columbia South Carolina on Monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters a man who truly loves the people of South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster Henry worked so hard was so loyal to me that I look forward to reciprocating The Border has been a big mess and problem for many years At some point Schumer and Pelosi who are weak on Crime and Border security will be forced to do a real deal so easy that solves this long time problem Schumer used to want Border security now he ll take Crime We shouldn t be hiring judges by the thousands as our ridiculous immigration laws demand we should be changing our laws building the Wall hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password ALL TIME RECORD OPTIMISM Just returning from the Great State of Minnesota where we had an incredible rally with people and at least who could not get in I will

packed arena I LOVE YOU ALL Just landed in Duluth Minnesota Two events planned looking forward to them and being with PeteStauber and his wonderful family Don t worry the Republicans and your President will fix it Look what Fake ABC News put out I guess they had it prepared from the Angry Democrats leading the Witch Hunt StopTheBias Had a great meeting with the House GOP last night at the Capitol They applauded and laughed loudly when I mentioned my experience with Mark Sanford I have never been a fan of his More records MAGA  FBI texts have revealed anti Trump Bias FoxNews Big News but the Fake News doesn t want to cover Total corruption the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly too big a story It s the Democrats fault they won t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation They want open borders which breeds horrible crime Republicans want security But I am working on something it never ends The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the Dems will do anything not to change them to obstruct want open borders which means crime THANK YOU HouseGOP Earlier today FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain to the WhiteHouse Homeland Security SecNielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete nasty laws which force family separation We want heart and security in America I want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Border it has been going on for many many decades THANK YOU NFIB NFIB Join me tomorrow in Duluth Minnesota for a MAGA Rally Tickets  CHANGETHELAWS Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration Get it done always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally Of the children are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions Democrats are the problem They don t care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our Country like MS They can t win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters If you don t have Borders you don t have a Country Crime in Germany is up plus officials do not want to report these crimes since migrants were accepted Others countries are even worse Be smart America I can t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election A Rigged Witch Hunt pComey gave Strozk his marching orders Mueller is Comey s best friend Witch Hunt If President Obama who got nowhere with North Korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed had gotten along with North Korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that I have the Fake News would have named him a national hero It is the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime Tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by Crime coming from illegal immigration Change the laws CHANGE THE LAWS Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border It is historic with some countries the most dangerous places in the world Not going to happen in the U S We don t want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition Crime in Germany is way up Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture Why don t the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world s worst immigration laws Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including MS coming into our country illegally  The highest level of bias I ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer Trey Gowdy on the FBI s own Peter Strzok Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller A really sick deal isn t it The Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something out on Border Security Safety Don t wait until after the election because you are going to lose Why was the FBI s sick loser Peter Strzok working on the totally discredited Mueller team of Angry Conflicted Democrats when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer Lisa Page that we ll stop Trump from becoming President Witch Hunt Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media They are not supposed to be doing that and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News they put their own spin on it truth doesn t matter to them WITCH HUNT There was no Russian Collusion Oh I see there was no Russian Collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax Too bad they didn t look at Crooked Hillary like this Double Standard Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn t paying them enough I think a really long strike would be a great idea Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time Is WaPo a registered lobbyist Our economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been Companies doing really well and moving back to America and jobs numbers are the best in years The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia They are so happy Over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win even if it does save potentially millions millions of lives Holding back the war games during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation Also quite provocative Can start up immediately if talks break down which I hope will not happen Funny how the Fake News in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I met That s because that s all they have to disparage We got so much for peace in the world more is being added in finals Even got our hostages remains Daniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal This IG Report makes it clear as did Rod Rosenstein s memo that Trump was absolutely justified unquestionably justified in firing Jim Comey So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now Witch Hunt Please clear up the Fake News Chuck Schumer said the Summit was what the Texans call all cattle and no hat Thank you Chuck but are you sure you got that right No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites Hostages already back hero remains coming home much more The IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History My supporters are the smartest strongest most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history It is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country As we get stronger so does our country Best numbers ever Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation for a change This is why we need more Republicans elected in November Democrats are good at only three things High Taxes High Crime and Obstruction Sad Great discussions with European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and EU Council President Donald Tusk at the G Summit in Canada last week The Fake News Media said that I did not get along with other Leaders at the G Summit in Canada They are once again WRONG I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos implying anger of negotiating an agreement where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for I ve had to beat very talented people including the Bush Dynasty then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report and never forget the Fake News Media It never ends Wow what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort who has represented Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns Didn t know Manafort was the head of the Mob What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others Very unfair The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall end Catch Release Visa Lottery and Chain and go to Merit Based Immigration Go for it WIN  Donald Trump was right to fire James Comey Mark Levin Why in the world didn t Barack Obama fire this guy Comey asks Mark Levin Wow the highest rated by far morning show foxandfriends is on the Front Lawn of the White House Maybe I ll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them U S A Jobs numbers are the BEST in years If my opponent the Democrats had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations the economy and jobs would have been a disaster Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U S A Mexico and Canada I worked hard on this along with a Great Team of talented people We never fail and it will be a great World Cup A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey his minions and sadly the FBI Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader by far in the history of the FBI I did a great service to the people in firing him Good Instincts Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back FBI Agent Peter Strzok who headed the Clinton Russia investigations texted to his lover Lisa Page in the IG Report that we ll stop candidate Trump from becoming President Doesn t get any lower than that Happy FlagDay Happy rd Birthday to the USArmy Thank you for your bravery sacrifices and dedication to the U S A We love you  Schneiderman who ran the Clinton campaign in New York never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case which lingered in their office for almost years Now he resigned his office in disgrace and his disciples brought it when we would not settle The sleazy New York Democrats and their now disgraced and run out of town A G Eric Schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in and gave out to charity more money than it took in I won t settle this case So the Democrats make up a phony crime Collusion with the Russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak Comey classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News Now that I am back from Singapore where we had a great result with respect to North Korea the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime The Republican Party is starting to show very big numbers People are starting to see what is being done Results are speaking loudly North Korea

upset so phony Josh Hawley should win big and has my full endorsement So funny to watch the Fake News especially NBC and CNN They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea days ago they would have begged for this deal looked like war would break out Our Country s biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools Oil prices are too high OPEC is at it again Not good The U S together with Mexico and Canada just got the World Cup Congratulations a great deal of hard work We save a fortune by not doing war games as long as we are negotiating in good faith which both sides are Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem No longer sleep well tonight Just landed a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience North Korea has great potential for the future Congratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia Now he runs against a total stiff Tim Kaine who is weak on crime and borders and wants to raise your taxes through the roof Don t underestimate Corey a major chance of winning  realize the economy is the best it s ever been with employment being at an all time high and many companies pouring back into our country Wake up Punchy Robert De Niro a very Low IQ individual has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies I watched him

with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate and Sanford was so bad I had to give it a shot Congrats to Katie Arrington A year ago the pundits talking heads people that couldn t do the job before were begging for conciliation and peace please meet don t go to war Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un the same haters shout out you shouldn t meet do

Kim our day together was historic I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people Our unprecedented meeting the first between an American

excitement in the air  Germany pays slowly of GDP towards NATO while we pay of a MUCH larger GDP Does anybody believe that makes sense We protect Europe which is good at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade Change is coming  And add to that the fact that the U S pays close to the entire cost of NATO protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade they pay only a fraction of the cost and laugh The European Union had a Billion Surplus should pay much more for Military Why should I as President of the United States allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses as they have for decades while our Farmers Workers Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay Not fair to the PEOPLE of America Billion Trade Deficit Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal According to a Canada release they make almost Billion Dollars in Trade with U S guess they were bragging and got caught Minimum is B Tax Dairy from us at Then Justin acts hurt when called out PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our G meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that US Tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around Very dishonest weak Our Tariffs are in response to his of on dairy Based on Justin s false statements at his news conference and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U S farmers workers and companies I have instructed our U S Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U S Market  Create peace and great prosperity for his land I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one time opportunity will not be wasted I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before The United

Abuse for many decades and that is long enough  U S A Trade They fully understand where I am coming from After many decades fair and reciprocal Trade will happen Just left the G Summit in beautiful

about North Korea and now weak on Crime High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran we don t need his advice Why isn t the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non monetary Trade Barriers against the U S Totally unfair to our farmers workers companies Take down your tariffs barriers or we will more than match you Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the U S and Canada had over the many years and all sorts

possible The political pundits just don t get what is going on out there or they do get it but refuse to report the facts Remember Dems are High Tax High Crime easy to beat  Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world was really ill or whatever Fake News is really bad The Fake News Media has been so unfair and vicious to my wife and our great First Lady Melania During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death to facelift to left the W H and me for N Y or Virginia to abuse All Fake she is doing really well Gold Star father Ceejay Metcalf whose great son Michael was just honored at the White House was fantastic this morning on foxandfriends He is a special man Great night for Republicans Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California He can win Even Fake News CNN said the Trump impact was really big much bigger than they ever thought possible So much for the big Blue Wave it may be a big Red Wave Working hard Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senate s August Recess Great maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes We need Border Security  The greatest Witch Hunt in political history  This is a level of criminality beyond the pale This is such a grave abuse of power and authority it s like nothing else we ve seen in our history This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuffChris Farrell Judicial Watch They were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U S These are all violations of law This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election There s nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system Great interview by LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign SPYGATE at the highest level Who would believe Wow Strzok Page the incompetent corrupt FBI lovers have texts referring to a counter intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December SPYGATE is in full force Is the Mainstream Media interested yet Big stuff Imagine how much wasteful spending we d save if we didn t have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way For years Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending and to what end No more The HISTORIC Rescissions Package we

together Started the Wall  NASCAR and Champion MartinTruex Jr were recently at the White House It was a great day for a great sport Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big we will soon see The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues all because Jeff Sessions didn t tell me he was going to recuse himself I would have quickly picked someone else So much time and money wasted so many lives ruined and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs Houston Astros Pittsburgh Penguins New England Patriots Alabama and Clemson National Champions and many others National Anthem more great music today at P M We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at P M The White House with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus Honoring America NFL no escaping to Locker Rooms The U S has an increased economic value of more than Trillion Dollars since the Election May be the best economy in the history of our country Record Jobs numbers Nice What is taking so long with the Inspector General s Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey Numerous delays Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker There are so many horrible things to tell the public has the right to know Transparency The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House Unfortunately only a small number of players decided to come and we canceled the event Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling Sorry Big Supreme Court ruling for Baker just out In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job The Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt  Days of American Greatness The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL Despite that we play the game because I unlike the Democrats have done nothing wrong Farmers have not been doing well for years Mexico Canada China and others have treated them unfairly By the time I finish trade talks that will change Big trade barriers against U S farmers and other businesses will finally be broken Massive trade deficits no longer The U S has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only WIN China already charges a tax of on soybeans Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our Agricultural products Not acceptable As has been stated by numerous legal scholars I have the absolute right to PARDON myself but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong In the meantime the never ending Witch Hunt led by very Angry and Conflicted Democrats others continues into the mid terms  This is the best time EVER to look for a job James Freeman of WSJ  We had Repeal Replace done and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars except for one person but it is getting done anyway Individual Mandate is gone and great less expensive plans will be announced this month Drug prices coming down Right to Try This is my th Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot many believe more than any President in his first days Massive Tax Regulation Cuts Military Vets Lower Crime Illegal Immigration Stronger Borders Judgeships Best Economy Jobs EVER and much more Mark Penn Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff Why is there an Independent Counsel To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses Constitution was set up to prevent this Stormtrooper tactics almost A disgrace  Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time he represented Ronald Reagan Bob Dole many others over the years but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he wouldn t have been hired As only one of two people left who could become President why wouldn t the FBI or Department of Justice have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort on charges that were years old and had been previously dropped during my campaign Should have told me Jesse Watters The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House So true When you re almost Billion Dollars a year down on Trade you can t lose a Trade War The U S has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade time to get smart Why is it that the Wall Street Journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U S by other countries or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into U S coffers The United States must at long last be treated fairly on Trade If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods and they charge us or even percent to sell ours it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated That is not Free or Fair Trade it is Stupid Trade There was No Collusion with Russia except by the Democrats When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end So bad for our Country Is the Special Counsel Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media Should be looking at Dems corruption instead Real FoxNews is doing great Fake News CNN is dead Very surprised that China would be doing this Now this is a record that will never be broken  million spent it s a scam Investigation Americans are being worked We now know there was Russian collusion with Russians and the Democrats The Mueller team is stacked with anti Trumpers who actually represented Clinton people gave s to Crooked H Dan Bongino John Brennan no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar Not only is he a liar he s a liar about being a liar Dan Bongino on foxandfriends We ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are Neil Irwin of the nytimes Today it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time Highly restrictive on Trade They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers They report a really high surplus on trade with us Do Timber Lumber in U S Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at this morning Why aren t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show A total double standard but that s O K we are Winning and will be doing so for a long time to come A P has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over million and going up fast No Collusion except by the Democrats FAIR TRADE Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D Souza today He was treated very unfairly by our government Very good meetings with North Korea Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people Spies Informants into my campaign Surveillance much Iger where is my call of apology You and ABC have offended millions of people and they demand a response How is Brian Ross doing He tanked the market with an ABC lie yet no apology Double Standard RUSH LIMBAUGH If the FBI was so concerned and if they weren t targeting Trump they should have told Trump If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign hoax then why not try to stop it Why not tell Trump Because they were pushing this scam  The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States JOE DIGENOVA former U S Attorney The soon to be released book The Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump written by Gregg Jarrett looks like a real deal big hit The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see Out in weeks Very importantly

Jarrett to let her know that ABC does not tolerate comments like those made by Roseanne Barr Gee he never called President Donald J Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC Maybe I just didn t get the call The Failing and Corrupt nytimes estimated the crowd last night at people when in fact it was many times that number and the arena was rockin This is the way they demean and disparage They are very dishonest people who don t get me and never did  There are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody else And I wish I did  chief law enforcement officer and they told me later oh by the way I m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office I would be frustrated too and that s how I read that Senator Sessions why didn t you tell me before I picked you Rep Trey Gowdy I don t think so I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job not afterward If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country s The Fake Mainstream Media has from the time I announced I was running for President run the most highly sophisticated dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics No matter how well WE do they find fault But the forgotten men women WON I m President Sorry I ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear bad Trade Deals VA Choice the Economy rebuilding the Military and so much more and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton Russia FBI Justice Obama Comey Lynch etc Why aren t the Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton It s a Rigged Witch Hunt that s why Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration The Angry Democrats plus people who worked years for Obama working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt will be MEDDLING with the mid term elections especially now that Republicans stay tough are taking the lead in Polls There was no Collusion except by the Democrats  This investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about It wasn t just a wiretap against a campaign aide it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign people call that Spying this is unprecedented and scandalous Mollie HemingwayWe have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit and more Kim Young Chol the Vice Chairman of North Korea heading now to New York Solid response to my letter thank you Democrats mistakenly tweet pictures from Obama s term showing children from the Border in steel cages They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country Bipartisan Bill California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems along with so many others On June th vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX a really good and highly competent man He ll Make California Great Again A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts no chance This is too good to be true for Republicans Remember the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS gang members not good Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served They cared for their families more than anything in the world they loved their families They inspired their communities The heroes who rest in these hallowed fields in cemeteries battlefields and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of American life They came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies from privilege and from poverty Thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance We are gathered here on the sacred soil of ArlingtonNatl Cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of America s greatest heroes the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom MemorialDay  We now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation That raises legitimate questions I just find this really odd this goes to the heart of our electoral system Jonathan Turley on FoxNews Sally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable Jonathan Turley The President deserves some answers FoxNews in discussing SPYGATE Happy Memorial Day Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today Best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER women in years rebuilding our Military and so much more Nice  MemorialDay Why didn t President Obama do something about the so called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn t want to upset the apple cart He was in charge not me and did nothing Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this It will happen Why didn t the Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton many crimes much Collusion with Russia Why didn t the FBI take the Server from the DNC Rigged Investigation Fantastic to have GREAT MEN WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D C showing their patriotism They love our Country they love our Flag they stand for our National Anthem Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller Who s going to give back the young and beautiful lives and others that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt They journeyed down to Washington D C with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation They went back home in tatters WELCOME HOME JOSH When will the Angry Democrats those who worked for President O reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest It s been a long time now Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems Justice FBI Russia This whole Russia Probe is Rigged Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven t been lost in decades Angry Democrats and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for years SPYGATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST With Spies or Informants as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister but it s not all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or Justice contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem The Failing nytimes quotes a senior White House official who doesn t exist as saying even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on June would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed WRONG AGAIN Use real people not phony sources Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to how to deal with North Korea and if there was it wouldn t matter The nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning Thanks to very brave Teacher Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville Indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House The great people of Utah are Celebrating Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U S Catch and Release Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS THUGS Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela Should be landing in D C this evening and be in the White House with his family at about P M The great people of Utah will be very happy We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which if it does happen will likely remain in Singapore on the same date June th and if necessary will be extended beyond that date  but complain and obstruct They made only bad deals Iran and their so called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase U S parts and pay a Billion fine Dems do nothing Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don t even know what the deals are and when for years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States Lost almost Billion year under O Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won t let them do their job The killings are at a record pace and tough police work which Chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fast the killings must stop To the NavalAcademy Class of I say We know you are up to the task We know you will make us proud We know that glory will be yours Because you are WINNERS you are WARRIORS you are FIGHTERS you are CHAMPIONS and YOU will lead us to VICTORY God Bless the U S A On behalf of the American People CONGRATULATIONS We love you Today it was my great honor to deliver the Commencement Address at the United States NavalAcademy in Annapolis Maryland Congratulations Good luck Godspeed And ANCHORS AWEIGH Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea We will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace Only time and talent will tell Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea Just like they are coming to the defense of MS thugs saying that they are individuals must be nurtured or asking to end your big Tax Cuts raise your taxes instead Dems have lost touch  Everyone knows there was a Spy and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy Widespread Spying involving multiple people Mollie Hemingway The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain And to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money LOST The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party s campaign is different than having a Spy as illegal as that may be But what about an Informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the Russian Hoax Today it was my great honor to present the MedalOfHonor to USNavy SEAL Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the WhiteHouse Full ceremony Today it was my honor to sign S the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act Read more I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June th While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world It was my great honor to host a roundtable re MS yesterday in Bethpage New York Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives Sadly I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un Not surprisingly the GREAT Men Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI SPYGATEClapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign Large dollars were paid to the Spy far beyond normal Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U S history SPYGATE a terrible thing Will be interviewed on foxandfriends tomorrow morning at A M Enjoy Great to be in New York for the day Heading back to the WhiteHouse now lots of work to be done Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage New York Keep up the great work Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes including the disgraceful practice known as Catch and Release Democrats must abandon their resistance Today on Long Island we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of MS I was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the State of the Union Thank you SBAList SBAGala WITCH HUNT There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough Big legislation will be signed by me shortly After many years RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion  Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign No James Clapper I am not happy Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot Everybody is with Tomi Lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman foxandfriendsSPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history  It s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign Judge Andrew NapolitanoLook how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State They go after Phony Collusion with Russia a made up Scam and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before What goes around comes around  foxandfriends New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign Even Clapper worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities  Follow the money The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia because there was no Collusion He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win just like they did to Bernie Sanders who got duped If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal For the first time since Roe v Wade America has a Pro Life President a Pro Life Vice President a Pro Life House of Representatives and Pro Life Republican State Capitals It was my honor to welcome NASCAR Cup Series Champion MartinTruex Jr and his team to the WhiteHouse yesterday Today it was my great honor to welcome President Moon Jae in of the Republic of Korea to the WhiteHouse  AsaHutchinson the great Governor of Arkansas is in a primary tomorrow He has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes border security and crime prevention Asa loves our military and our veterans I fully endorse Asa for Governor Under our potential deal with China they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce The Wall Street Journal asks WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA A very good question  they then used to start an investigation about Trump It is that simple This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle This was a Political hit job this was not an Intelligence Investigation Brennan has disgraced himself he s worried about staying out of Jail Dan Bongino top of the FBI Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony Dossier he knows about the Dossier he denies knowledge of the Dossier he briefs the Gang of on the Hill about the Dossier which  John Brennan is panicking He has disgraced himself he has disgraced the Country he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American s faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the China must continue to be strong tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in I want this to happen and North Korea to be VERY successful but only after signing On China Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm Agricultural Products would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years I ask Senator Chuck Schumer why didn t President Obama the Democrats do something about Trade with China including Theft of Intellectual Property etc They did NOTHING With that being said Chuck I have long agreed on this issue Fair Trade plus with China will happen I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia so now they re looking at the rest of the World Oh great  and why hasn t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington D C What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of Democrats FBI They broke into homes offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World they should easily be able to take it into the Mid Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party Don t worry about Dems FISA Abuse missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier  in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted Emails got while Secretary of State paid McCabes wife and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M and so much more Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam  At what point does this soon to be Witch Hunt composed of Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for years STOP They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they aren t looking at the corruption Things are really getting ridiculous The Failing and Crooked but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton nytimes has done a long boring story indicating that the World s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia me so now they are looking at the rest of the World If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee also Senate Judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers Drain the Swamp Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House Melania is feeling and doing really well Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes Happy ArmedForcesDay to our GREAT military men and women for their selfless service to our Nation

shooting in Texas Early reports not looking good God bless all Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president It took

the Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia led by Clinton best friend Terry M under FBI investigation that they killed gave to McCabe s wife in her run for office Then dropped case on Clinton Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants Animals Wrong They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories I referred to MS Gang Members as Animals a big difference and so true Fake

the most successful first month Administration in U S history by far Sorry to the Fake News Media and Haters but that s the way it is Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT Andrew McCarthy says There s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign If so this is bigger than Watergate Congratulations America we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate

no such people and don t know these characters just more Fake Disgusting News to create ill will James Comey s Memos are Classified I did not Declassify them They belong to our Government Therefore he broke the law Additionally he totally made up many of the things he said I said and he is already a proven liar and leaker Where are Memos on Clinton Lynch others Sylvester Stallone called me with the

Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles Also will Shut down a nuclear test site in the country s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests Progress being made for all James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council Therefore the Special Council was established based on an illegal act

James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe under the bus Inspector General s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them Getting a little lot of their own medicine Sanctuary Cities released at least Gang Members across the United States making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed We are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in America difficult My thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two GCSOFlorida deputies HEROES who lost their lives in the line of duty today Mike Pompeo is outstanding First in his class at West Point A top student at Harvard Law School A success at whatever he has done We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP He will be a great Secretary

NO COLLUSION except by the Dems Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed Details of Summit are being worked out now Denuclearization will be a great thing for World but also for North Korea A sketch years later about a nonexistent man A total con job playing the Fake News Media for Fools but they know it There is a Revolution going on in California Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous crime infested breeding concept Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border but the people of the State are not happy Want Security Safety NOW While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don t like the deal for the United States Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn t work Bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for OUR workers Look how bad WTO is to U S Pastor Andrew Brunson a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the

treated so badly by online retailers Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores  Congress House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from

crisis that can only be fixed by Welcome Prime Minister Abe Rasmussen just came out at Approval despite the Fake News Media They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News Washington Post and they haven t changed get new pollsters Much of the media is a Scam Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan a truly fine gentleman So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill Everyone is talking really nice to see Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border

forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan Working on Trade and Military Security Employment is up Taxes are DOWN Enjoy Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U S keeps raising interest rates Not acceptable Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her lied in Congress to Senator G then based his decisions on her poll numbers Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes Just hit in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point With all of the phony stories and Fake News it s hard to believe Thank you America we are doing Great Things Slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack he is not smart will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past I have many too many lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken All lawyers are deflated and concerned I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty I hardly even knew this guy Just another of his many lies His memos are self serving and FAKE The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term Mission Accomplished I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back Use often Comey throws AG Lynch under the bus Why can t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary No golf and grandkids talk give us all a break The big questions in Comey s badly reviewed book aren t answered like how come he gave up Classified Information jail why did he lie to Congress jail why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI why didn t they TAKE it why the phony memos McCabe s more Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the Clinton Email probe In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job Slimeball So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had There won t be anything or anyone even close A perfectly executed strike last night Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military Could not have had a better result Mission Accomplished DOJ just issued the McCabe report which is a total disaster He LIED LIED LIED McCabe was totally controlled by Comey McCabe is Comey No collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes We are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words MADE IN THE USA  untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible Director of the FBI His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history It was my great honor to fire James Comey James Comey is a proven LEAKER LIAR Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did until he was in fact fired He leaked CLASSIFIED information for which he should be prosecuted He lied to Congress under OATH He is a weak and Tremendous pressure is building like never before for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities Started the Wall in San Diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it They will soon be protected Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres Obama We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations Japan

billions of dollars P O leaders don t have a clue or do they Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling Just hit which is higher than Cheatin Obama at the same time in his Administration Check out the fact that you can t get a job at ratings challenged CNN unless you state that you are totally anti Trump Little Jeff Zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our Weak Laws Border had better be stopped before it gets there Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen Congress MUST ACT NOW The Fake News Networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast The Fakers at CNN NBC ABC CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction  AutismAwarenessDay LightItUpBlue  President Trump s approval rate among likely U S voters hit percent on Monday which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama s score at the same point into his first term according to a new poll Via Anna Giaritelli DCExaminer  of my nominations including Diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay At this rate it would take more than years before I am allowed to have these great people start working Never happened before Disgraceful Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the U S is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES Caravans are heading here Must pass tough laws and build the WALL Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime As ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from A whole big wasted procedure must take place Mexico Canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an Obama joke ACT CONGRESS President Donald J Trump Proclaims April World Autism Awareness Day An honor to host the Annual WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll So sad that the Department of Justice and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress An embarrassment to our country Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country not a level playing field So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA They have very strong border laws ours are pathetic With all of the money they make from the U S hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws DACA is dead because the Democrats didn t care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon No longer works Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime  Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People Border Patrol Agents and ICE are GREAT but the weak Dem laws don t allow them to do their job Act now Congress our country is being stolen Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA They want in on the act Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the U S They laugh at our dumb immigration laws They must stop the big drug and people

great deal for American and Korean workers Let s now focus on our important security relationship Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me In the meantime and unfortunately maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost For years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity Look forward to our meeting THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED As much as Democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens NO WAY We need more Republicans in and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court I am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the President s Park in April I encourage all to visit and remember those who we

help He is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in NH and beyond He calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times The book is called What Really Happened Enjoy MAGA  President Donald J Trump Proclaims March as Greek Independence Day A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy Happy National MedalOfHonorDay to our HEROES We love you  lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed if for no other reason than they can bill more which is unfair to our great country and I am very happy with my existing team Besides there was NO COLLUSION with Russia except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case don t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on Fame fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted Problem is that a new Much can be done with the Billion given to building and fixing the border wall It is just a down payment Work will start immediately The rest of the money will come and remember DACA the Democrats abandoned you but we will not Because of the Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military many jobs are created and our Military is again rich Building a great Border Wall with drugs poison and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about National Defense Build WALL through M France honors a great hero Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism Even stronger measures needed especially at borders Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday and we grieve the nation s loss We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support We are with you EmmanuelMacron As a matter of National Security I ve signed the Omnibus Spending Bill I say to Congress I will NEVER sign another bill like this again To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again I m calling on Congress to give me a line item veto for all govt spending bills Obama Administration legalized bump stocks BAD IDEA As I promised today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill P M I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats not even mentioned in Bill and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded DACA was abandoned by the Democrats Very unfair to them Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report FINDINGS No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign Russia The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts I am pleased to announce that effective AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor I am very thankful for the service of General H R McMaster who has done an outstanding job will always remain my friend There will be an official contact handover on My honor Charlie thank you MAGA As a candidate I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade protect American workers and defend our national security Today we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary s large and highly sophisticated staff Well not saying that anymore Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault He doesn t know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way Don t threaten people Joe Democrats refused to take care of DACA Would have been so easy but they just didn t care I had to fight for Military and start of Wall Got Billion to start Wall on Southern Border rest will be forthcoming Most importantly got Billion to rebuild our Military Billion next year most ever Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment  They can help solve problems with North Korea Syria Ukraine ISIS Iran and even the coming Arms Race Bush tried to get along but didn t have the smarts Obama and Clinton tried but didn t have the energy or chemistry remember RESET PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past Obama called him also The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him They are wrong Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing  Special Council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I am still opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because  there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona I agree with LouDobbs Should have sought review AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD Great job by law enforcement and all concerned Our Nation was founded by farmers Our independence was won by farmers And our continent was tamed by farmers Our farmers always lead the way we are PROUD of them and we are DELIVERING for them NationalAgricultureDayThe Democrats do not want to help DACA Would be so easy to make a deal A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest  seanhannity on foxandfriends now Great A M Why does the Mueller team have hardened Democrats some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans Another Dem recently added does anyone think this is fair And yet there is NO COLLUSION Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me I don t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date Same with lying James Comey Can we call them Fake Memos Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked have you ever been an anonymous source or known someone else to be an anonymous source He said strongly never no He lied as shown clearly on foxandfriends The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign WITCH HUNT The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife s campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation How many lies How many leaks Comey knew it all and much more As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice State DrainTheSwampHappy StPatricksDay Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI A great day for Democracy Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI  U S Consumer Confidence Hits Year High It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada and it s unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller who is doing a really good job could run for Senate unopposed Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the Iraq Syria border yesterday Their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten  President

justice because he s exercising his power as the President of the U S I just don t see it Judge Ken Starr I ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year I just don t see the evidence in terms of the collusion it s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have Jonathan Turley on FoxNews He s got a very good point Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs Clinton s criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated I fully agree with the President on that judgenapolitano on marthamaccallum ShowI will be interviewed by JudgeJeanine on FoxNews at P M Enjoy  Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts FoxNews So what else is new He is a total phony  Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump FoxNews Of course not because there is none and never was This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace and Obama did nothing about Russia Dem Memo FBI did not disclose who the clients were the Clinton Campaign and the DNC Wow The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST Just confirms all of the terrible things that

better job of working with President Trump starting to happen Dems are no longer talking DACA Out of sight out of mind they say DACA beneficiaries should not be happy Nancy Pelosi truly doesn t care

judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania FoxNews This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP Armed Educators and trusted people who work within a school love our students and will protect them Very smart people Must be firearms adept have annual training Should get yearly bonus

Country and will do the right thing MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health Raise age to and end sale of Bump Stocks Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue I hope  If a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school Cowards won t go there problem solved Must be offensive defense alone won t work  History shows that a school shooting lasts on average minutes It takes police first responders approximately to minutes to get to site of crime Highly trained gun adept teachers coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive GREAT DETERRENT  immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this Far more assets at much less cost than guards A gun free school is a magnet for bad people ATTACKS WOULD END I never said give teachers guns like was stated on Fake News CNN NBC What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience only the best of teachers a lot would now be able toI will always remember the time I spent today with

wise Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law This shows small business owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses  cameras running Another False Accusation Why doesn t washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me One had her home mortgage paid off Only FoxNews so reported doesn t fit the Mainstream Media narrative A woman I don t know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of Trump Tower years ago Never happened Who would do this in a public space with live security I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts Total Fake News Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new pushed Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary Your Original was correct Don t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes waste money Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House You ve come a long way Matt Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially Also they want to do nothing on DACA R s want to fix  The President Obama quote just before election That s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn t want to rock the boat When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems  There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America s elections there s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so I d invite Mr Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes Thank you to foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more We are now starting to win again  The Faith of Donald Trump a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb is a very interesting read Enjoy The U S economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations Taxes have been massively Cut JOBS JOBS JOBS MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to OrrinHatch and has my full support and endorsement Obama was President up to and beyond the Election So why didn t he do something about Russian meddling Have a great but very reflective President s Day Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey who at one point I knew very well interview a panel of people on Minutes The questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today The Daytona Brian France and the France family are special people Enjoy the race Thank you to KenStarr former Independent Counsel Whitewater for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse Russian meddling etc Really great interview with MariaBartiromoGreat Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot Big gain over last weeks I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away We need more Republicans The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the U S then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams They are laughing their asses off in Moscow Get smart America Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the election But wasn t I a great candidate I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia it never did Finally Liddle Adam Schiff the leakin monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the Election He is finally right about something Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing Thank you Adam Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter This is not acceptable They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no collusion Get back to the basics and make us all proud Just like they don t want to solve the DACA problem why didn t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House Senate during the Obama Administration Because they didn t want to and now they just talk  I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was NOT the main goal Rob Goldman Vice President of Facebook Ads The Fake News Media never fails Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman Funny how the Fake News Media doesn t want to say that the Russian group was formed in long before my run for President Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn t know Deputy A G Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the election  Charges Deal Don A Big Win written by Michael Goodwin of the nypost succinctly states that the Russians had no impact on the election results There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign She lost the old fashioned way by being a terrible candidate Case closed Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida Will never forget them or the evening Our entire Nation w one heavy heart continues to pray for the victims their families in Parkland FL To teachers law enforcement first responders medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger We THANK YOU for your courage Russia started their anti US campaign in long before I announced that I would run for President The results of the election were not impacted The Trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats totally abandoned Republicans are still working hard I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth but people whose lives have been totally shattered Am also working with Congress on many fronts Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida  lottery continues deadly catch and release and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement and a vote FOR open borders If Dems are actually serious about DACA they should support the Grassley bill The Schumer Rounds Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe DHSgov says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in America It creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals doesn t build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa In times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem Must always report such instances to authorities again and again Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school Today I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America s depleted infrastructure As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African Americans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all Proclamation Negotiations on DACA have begun Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal Wouldn t it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity March th Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more Bipartisan make deal Dems The journey to MAGA began CPAC and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year See you at CPAC Thank you to Sue Kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge for your kind words while on foxandfriends We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard Nick will not have died in vain This will be a big week for Infrastructure After so stupidly spending trillion in the Middle East it is now time to start investing in OUR Country Just spoke to JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from WestervillePD This is a true tragedy Rep Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator He is strong smart loves Pennsylvania loves our Country Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer  million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut Jobs Bill and it will only get better We are far ahead of schedule So many positive things going on for the U S A and the Fake News Media just doesn t want to go there Same negative stories over and over again No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history MAGAMy Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the WestervillePD Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do The Dems had all three branches of government back in and they decided not to do anything about DACA They only want to use it as a campaign issue Vote Republican  agencies not just the FBI DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I don t believe were accurate he leaked information corrupt Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on FoxNews My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton DNC Dossier it shows that he s been victimized He s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation Some are true and some are false Some are old and some are new There is no recovery for someone falsely accused life and career are gone Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process According to the nytimes a Russian sold phony secrets on Trump to the U S Asking price was million brought down to million to be paid over time I hope people are now seeing understanding what is going on here It is all now starting to come out DRAIN THE SWAMP The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods and more would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency Told them to re do and send back in proper form Jobless claims have dropped to a year low Costs on non military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the Election and beyond This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage Must elect more Republicans in Election Just signed Bill Our Military will now be stronger than ever before We love and need our Military and gave them everything and more First time this has happened in a long time Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS Wow Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist

Wall Street Journal The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the election and its aftermath The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier the FBI became Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages and nobody even talks about them Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion This memo totally vindicates Trump in probe But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead This is an American disgrace Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain sacred cows Other Trump polls are way up also So why does the media refuse to write this Oh well someday Today it was my

world If there is no Wall there is no Deal Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election March Rick is a great guy We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda  The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous billion dollar trade surplus with the U S The billion dollar Wall is peanuts compared to what Mexico makes from the U S NAFTA is a bad joke The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water ISIS is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more Together there is nothing we can t overcome even a very biased media We ARE Making America Great

President Donald J Trump Proclaims January as Religious Freedom Day Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled Thank you and it will get even much better FoxNews of Trump news coverage was negative and much of it contrived foxandfriendsDo you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems Public gets it The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now No more dangerous Lottery We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting Deals can t get made when there is no trust Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military  to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Statement by me last night in Florida Honestly I don t think the Democrats want to make a deal They talk about DACA but they don t want to help We are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don t want to They don t want security at the border they don t want  big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible among many other things President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline

modern times to from Election and grounded in profitability and growth All Trump not I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT No more Lotteries AMERICA FIRSTDACA is probably dead because the Democrats don t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military  and they knew exactly what I said and meant They just wanted a story FAKE NEWS The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un of N Korea Obviously I didn t say that I said I d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un a big difference Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters So much Fake News is being reported They don t even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election I don t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA They are all talk and no action This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have Too bad AMERICA FIRST The Democrats are all talk and no action They are doing nothing to fix DACA Great opportunity missed Too bad Yesterday was a big day for the stock market Jobs are coming

activities in honor of Dr King s life and legacy Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country Never said take them out Made up by Dems I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians Probably should record future meetings unfortunately no trust Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for DACA  Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards The Dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  countries which are doing badly I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level I want safety and security for our people I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund The so called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards Wall was not properly funded Chain Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for billion dollars Bad deal Wanted me to cut ribbon NO The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery

its politics and bad programming People are dumping it in RECORD numbers Apologize for untruth We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in years Must be proactive nasty The travel ban into the United States should be far larger tougher and more specific but stupidly that would not be politically correct Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off use better Another attack in London by a loser terrorist These are sick and demented people who were in
